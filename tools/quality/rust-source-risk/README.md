# Rust source-risk collector (candidate 0.1.0-rc.7)

This is an independent Harness-Gate collector plugin. It does not modify Core,
change a policy threshold, sign its own requests, or replace the MIR measurement
series. The original MIR collector remains useful for generated-code diagnostics.

## Measurement contract

`rust-explicit-decisions` starts each source callable at 1 and adds:

- 1 for each `if`/`if let`, `for`, `while`, `?`, `let ... else`, `&&`, and `||`;
- `max(match arms - 1, 0)` plus 1 per match guard;
- 1 for `matches!`, plus 1 for its optional guard.

An unconditional `loop` adds no decision. Functions, methods, default trait
methods, closures and explicit async blocks have separate owners. Nested owners
are not charged to their parent. Async state machines and generated derive/logging
control flow do not contribute to source complexity. This is a **new series**;
its numbers are not interchangeable with MIR CC or another tool's CC definition.

Supported expression macros are `matches!`, comma-separated expression arguments
of `tracing::{info,warn,error,debug,trace}!`, and `sqlx::migrate!`. User expressions
inside those arguments are visited (including `?`). Unsupported macro grammar,
other macros, item macros, conditional compilation attributes and unrecognized
attributes fail closed. The collector does not pretend to measure arbitrary Rust
macro expansions. Generated derive bodies are outside this source-only scope.

Original source positions are parsed with pinned `syn` 2.0.119. UTF-8 character
columns are converted to LLVM byte columns. LLVM 3.1.0 code-region exports join
only at exact AST entry anchors, never by a function name or basename fallback.
Every inventoried source callable needs a native mapping. Unknown region kinds,
cross-file expansions, duplicate native instances and ambiguous joins are rejected.
All `.rs` files under explicitly approved source roots are inventoried, including
files with only declarations. These declaration files have no function metrics.

Async factory counters do not cover the async body: only its execution/poll
mapping contributes to line, region and function coverage. Equal source ranges
from distinct native instantiations are merged by covered/not-covered status.
Innermost code ranges override enclosing ranges; nested callable ranges are
removed from the parent. A non-whitespace code interval is a line opportunity,
and any covered opportunity covers that line. Unknown gap/expansion region kinds
are currently rejected rather than guessed. This is source region coverage, not
branch coverage or a claim about implicit error/cleanup paths in MIR.

`CRAP = CC + CC² × (1 − covered_source_lines / source_lines)³`, represented as a
reduced exact rational. A missing denominator is not applicable, never zero risk.
Core alone evaluates the required **CRAP ≤ 10** policy. Full coverage therefore
passes CC=10 and still fails CC=11.

## Trust and transport

`capture.py` copies explicitly listed build/test inputs before executing locked
Cargo tests. It retains original binaries and `.profraw` counters, hashes source,
configuration, inputs and native tools, and records the exact toolchain. Capture
is a **local host utility**, not a production signing or isolation service.
A source commit field identifies the baseline; hashes bind actual dirty input
bytes. It is not an assertion that the capture is a clean checkout of that commit.

The collector revalidates those bytes and independently runs pinned
`llvm-profdata merge` and `llvm-cov export`. It does not trust a supplied coverage
summary. Raw native capture files remain in the receipt's retained `raw_root`;
archive this directory with the bundle for replay. Emitted evidence contains the
re-exported LLVM data and capture receipt. Production hosts must protect both
capture provenance and the signing key from repository-controlled tests.

The adapter-v2 bridge validates Core invocation context, signed binding digest,
complete subject/capability claims, and configuration identity. Core authenticates
signatures, rejects stale/replayed requests, validates artifacts and evaluates
policy. A transport `PASS` means collection succeeded, not that quality passed.

Artifacts use an exclusive `artifact_subdir` inside Core's shared output root so
other independent collectors can publish their own directories in the same run.
Existing files in this plugin's directory are rejected. Collectors never issue
quality overrides or contain signing keys.

## Build and use (source checkout)

The following build commands require the repository checkout. The published
archive already includes `inventory` and its runtime `ast/Cargo.lock`; preserve
both when installing or moving the plugin.

```sh
cargo build --locked --release --manifest-path ast/Cargo.toml
# Copy the resulting harness-gate-rust-source-inventory binary to ./inventory.
python3 -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 plugin.py discover --request /absolute/request.json
python3 plugin.py collect --request /absolute/request.json
```

`capture.py --help` documents snapshot arguments. `acceptance.py --bundle BUNDLE
--plugin PLUGIN_DIRECTORY` runs a backend-only, ephemeral-key Core rehearsal. It
refuses a real checkout and checks signature, stale context, expiration, replay
and artifact tampering. It is not the project's complete production gate.

The candidate currently targets Rust 1.97.1 / LLVM 22.1.6, cargo-llvm-cov 0.9.0,
Python 3.14 and Linux x86-64. New syntax/LLVM formats require compatibility tests
and a new identity before adoption.

## rc.2 business-source support

Declarative Serde deny-unknown-fields, tag/content, rename and skip metadata are
accepted; callback/custom metadata remains unsupported. json!/serde_json::json!
containers recursively visit every Rust expression, including object keys, nested
arrays, branches and closures. format!/std::format! visits expression arguments.
Unknown macros and malformed grammar still fail closed. Generated macro/derive
control flow remains outside this source-only metric. Exact LLVM entry anchors
include the argument of single-argument Ok/Err/Some closure bodies, where Rust
lowering omits the constructor wrapper. No nearest-position/name fallback is used.

## Select source syntax candidate

Fully qualified `tokio::select!` accepts `biased;`, future branches, optional
preconditions, block handlers without commas, and a final `else`. Complexity
adds alternatives minus one, syntactically refutable patterns, and preconditions.
Source decisions in futures, guards, and handlers are visited normally; nested
closures and async blocks retain their own source owners. Macro-generated poll
loops are excluded. Identifier bindings, wildcards, and empty tuple patterns are
syntactically irrefutable under this rule; this is not name/type resolution.
Malformed syntax and unknown nested macros fail closed. This syntax support does
not waive exact LLVM ownership or missing execution counters.

## Closure entry mapping candidate

Closure entry anchors follow the leading source AST expression through constructor
wrappers (`Ok`, `Err`, `Some`, including generic arguments), tuples, arrays, struct
fields, parentheses, unary/reference/cast/try/await expressions, and the first
operand or condition. Only structurally derived entry positions are accepted;
there is no nearest-position, name-based, or arbitrary contained-region fallback.
Nested callable ownership and source decision counts remain separate. A closure
returning an async block can have its factory counter at the closing brace;
this does not count the future as polled or cover its body.

`test_closures.py` compiles and executes real instrumented Rust fixtures, exports
LLVM coverage, and checks the joined metrics. The tests include uncalled closures,
unpolled async blocks, nested owners, and rejection of a later tuple element
masquerading as the entry. Set `RUST_SOURCE_INVENTORY` to test a candidate binary.

Some trivial projection closures (for example `|value: &i32| *value`) have no
independent coverage record in the tested compiler output. These still reject:
source syntax does not prove execution, and a parent's execution count must not
be substituted. Missing mappings are reported together, with source locations
and callable kinds, instead of requiring repeated attempts to expose each one.

Exact `#[cfg(test)]` modules are excluded from the production boundary, including external test modules. Other conditional configurations remain unsupported and fail closed.

## Signed candidate distribution

The Linux x86-64 archive includes the compiled `inventory`, Python entrypoints,
license, manifest and this guide. Rust/LLVM and Python remain external. See the
[release installation guide](../../../docs/releases/0.4.7.zh-CN.md).

## rc.6 package completeness

RC6 includes the dependency lockfile read by the measurement-series fingerprint.
The published RC5 archive omitted this file and cannot form a series. RC6 keeps
the measurement formulas unchanged, but its new collector identity and executable
pins require explicit host binding review. Release acceptance now extracts the
archive and runs the full runtime suite against its installed files.

## rc.7 complete compatibility diagnostics

Capture scans every production source file in the captured input snapshot before
starting cargo/llvm-cov. Unsupported syntax and Serde metadata are collected
across files, including all diagnostics emitted for each file. A rejected source
inventory never becomes a partial production boundary.

After native coverage is available, measurement collects unmatched or ambiguous
entry anchors, uninventoried project functions, and missing source-owner counters
before reporting failure. No measurements or successful capture bundle are
returned when any mapping is missing or ambiguous; parents' hits are never
substituted. Unsafe paths, unavailable tools, malformed native data and duplicate
native identities still stop immediately because continuing cannot be trusted.

This change does not broaden accepted Rust syntax, change coverage/CRAP formulas,
or lower thresholds. The new version and implementation digest require an
explicit host binding update; existing signed captures retain their old identity.
