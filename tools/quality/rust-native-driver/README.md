# Pinned native production measurement

This opt-in development collector uses rustc **1.97.1**, commit
`8bab26f4f68e0e26f0bb7960be334d5b520ea452`, LLVM **22.1.6** and
`rustc-mir-block-inventory/3`. It needs the matching `rustc-dev` and `llvm-tools`
components. It does not install or change a project's official gate or baseline.
Generic Core remains language independent; the released Rust CLI evaluates policy.

From this repository, with that Rust toolchain already available:

```sh
python3 tools/quality/rust-native-driver/bootstrap.py \
  --sysroot "$(rustc --print sysroot)" --output target/native-driver
export NATIVE_DRIVER="$PWD/target/native-driver/build/debug/harness-gate-rust-native-driver"
export NATIVE_DRIVER_SYSROOT="$(rustc --print sysroot)"
python3 tools/quality/rust_native_driver.py cargo \
  --source target/arc-admin/backend/Cargo.toml --output target/native-backend \
  --driver "$NATIVE_DRIVER" --sysroot "$NATIVE_DRIVER_SYSROOT" \
  --sample openapi_contract --sample permission_template_contract
```

Use a fresh output directory. `bootstrap.py --archive PATH` reuses a downloaded
archive after checking the same pinned official SHA. All installation overlays,
source copies, builds and profiles stay inside this checkout. The base toolchain
is read only. Run sampling only against project-owned tests and disposable test
services where needed. These two Arc-Admin contract tests need no database.

The collector prints a manifest SHA. Retain it in a trusted review record apart
from the evidence. Certification re-merges the original profiles and re-exports
LLVM data from the original binaries; it does not execute archived programs:

```sh
python3 tools/quality/rust_native_driver.py certify \
  --evidence target/native-backend/raw --anchor REVIEWED_SHA \
  --output target/native-backend/report.json
```

A successfully mapped report can exit **1** for real threshold failures. A
measurement exception also exits 1 but produces no successful report. Check the
report and retained stderr. No synthesized JSON constitutes native success.
Commands, exits, source hashes, selected Cargo targets/features/cfg, resolution
inputs, compiler definitions, expansion edges, binaries, raw profiles, and LLVM
export remain in the sealed evidence directory. Never reseal changed evidence to
reuse a reviewed anchor. Host-reviewed anchors provide integrity, not remote
producer attestation. Tool paths may be relocated only in a separately reviewed
capture; their bytes and versions remain part of the series identity.

## Ownership and counting

The driver installs independent physical LLVM counters at every typed MIR basic
block, including async bodies, closures, constructors and derived methods that
stock rustc coverage omits. Virtual `.mir-map` files make the block-to-LLVM join
bijective. All function definitions must have observed LLVM instances, including
zero-count instances. An uninstantiated/unmapped generic is an error. A parent's
counter never supplies a child's count. Distinct symbols of the same compiler
owner are summed; duplicated symbols/regions or ambiguous owners are errors.

Definition IDs are rustc DefPathHash values. Source spans carry SourceMap IDs,
bytes and complete recursive expansion call/definition sites and macro definition
IDs. The inventory also records every post-analysis compiler definition in index
order. Non-function constants/statics retain actual constant-evaluation MIR and
its SHA; expanded types retain declaration identity. Runtime definitions must
exactly match the runtime owner list. This accounts for constant/type-producing
`macro_rules!` without inferring runtime absence from the source AST.

`rust-native-production-mir-block/1` is a new series: **regions mean independent
MIR basic blocks, not stock rustc source coverage regions**. Lines are the union
of all local source origins attached to the block's statements and terminator,
including expansion definition and invocation lines. Any positive owned block
covers a projected line. Shared lines count once globally; separate owners and
blocks remain separate. Function coverage uses each owner's independent entry
counter. Complexity is E−N+2 on the typed normal CFG with one common exit;
parallel edges count, while unwind/cleanup, imaginary and coroutine-drop paths
are excluded. CRAP is exactly `CC² × (1 − covered_lines / lines)³ + CC`.
These rules intentionally differ from the old source/LLVM series; no old baseline
is imported, rewritten, or treated as comparable.

All declared lib/bin Cargo targets must be compiled. Separate integration-test
crates are recorded and excluded by target ownership, with their counters retained.
Mixed `cfg(test)` production library builds are unsupported and fail closed.
Dependency/std/generated dependency regions require a unique declared source root;
unknown roots fail. Project source files absent under the selected cfg remain in
the lexical source inventory as `compiler_loaded=false`, not "no executable code".
Build scripts remain raw build evidence and are excluded from application metrics.
Incremental compilation is disabled and rejected: cached custom MIR cannot safely
reuse generated SourceMap identities. Flags, selected cfg/features/targets, tool
hashes, Cargo manifests/lockfile, collector and projection rules partition history.

## Policy and tests

`../rust_native_policy.py --help` accepts two separately anchored captures,
reviewed base/head contexts, explicit hotspot selections and a released
`harness-gate` binary. It emits generic typed evidence and calls `quality evaluate`.
Line/region thresholds remain 80%, CRAP 30. Aggregate coverage is required;
changed CC>10 functions and selected hotspots require all thresholds, other
changed functions require CRAP, and all historical rows require non-regression.
Unchanged debt is reported, not erased. Missing or incompatible history rejects.
Compiler owner identity supports conservative content comparison across moves;
renames/splits/merges require reviewed `--mappings`, validated by Generic Core.
No permissive name heuristic or automatic baseline acceptance is provided.

```sh
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target/native-validation"
export HARNESS_GATE_NATIVE_POLICY_BINARY="$PWD/target/native-validation/debug/harness-gate"
cargo build --locked --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/quality/tests -p test_rust_native_driver.py -v
```

The real tests require the two `NATIVE_DRIVER*` variables above; without them they
report an explicit skip. They retain each real compile/sample/export and the
Rust policy outputs under `target/gh-220/driver-tests`. Small fixtures establish
their own scope only. The pinned Arc-Admin report and scope limitations are indexed
in [GH-220 evidence](../../../docs/quality/gh-220/README.md).
