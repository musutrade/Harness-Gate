# GH-269 target-specific risk measurement

PR #293 adds adapter replay state with Unix/Windows implementations. The
required risk series now also inventories `process/replay.rs`,
`project/discovery.rs`, and `project/mod.rs`. This changes measurement support;
it does not change adapter behavior, risk thresholds, or CI stage policy.

The AST analyzer is `harness-gate-rust-measure/0.3.1`. Both base and head must
be measured again with this analyzer, the same tool fingerprints, and the same
compiler configuration. Retained 0.3.0 reports are not reinterpreted as 0.3.1.
The McCabe counting rule, closure instrumentation, and incremental ratchet
remain unchanged.

`source_measure.py` reads `rustc --print cfg --target <triple>`. The required
risk collector passes that same triple to snapshot preparation and native
coverage collection/reporting. The exact compiler configuration is retained in
the manifest, AST inventory, each measurement report, and comparison. Reparse
checks and base/head comparison reject changed or missing configuration.

Supported predicates are only `unix`, `windows`, `test`, `not(atom)`, and
`all(atoms)`. The latter handles the existing `cfg(all(test, unix))` test module.
The production boundary sets `test` false and excludes `#[test]` functions.
Inactive modules, functions, methods, fields, and removable statements are
filtered before complexity counting and closure instrumentation. This includes
conditional blocks inside functions. Their original ranges are also excluded
from line-coverage denominators; an enclosing native region cannot manufacture
coverage for them. Original source bytes and positions remain bound to the
measurement, and every remaining production callable still needs its own
native record.

Feature/name-value predicates, `cfg_attr`, `any`, nested predicate expressions,
unsupported attribute positions, and conditional syntax inside opaque macro
arguments fail explicitly without emitting a partial inventory. A disabled
branch is not inspected for runtime macros, but every predicate on its own
attributes is validated. This is not a general macro or Cargo-feature resolver.

Focused checks:

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/quality/tests -p test_source_measure.py -v
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/quality/tests -p test_ci_quality.py -v
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/gh-94-measure cargo clippy \
  --manifest-path tools/quality/rust-measure/Cargo.toml --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --manifest-path tools/quality/rust-measure/Cargo.toml -- --check
```

The fixtures read real compiler configurations for Linux and Windows; host
assertions select the compiler's actual target. The
[Native Validation workflow](../../.github/workflows/rust-measure-native.yml)
builds `rust-measure/0.3.1` on Windows first, then macOS, and runs the small source
measurement suite on each host. Each job has a 15-minute timeout and retains only
fixture profiles, LLVM exports, the instrumentation manifest, tool/source hashes,
and measured results for seven days. No product workspace/build archive is
uploaded. These supplemental jobs do not change any existing required CI stages
or Engineering Policy semantics, complexity rules, thresholds, debt, or ratchet.

The real native fixture checks active/inactive platform functions and body ranges,
a zero-hit closure versus an executed closure, and fail-closed missing active
function/closure mappings. Unsupported cfg/macros and mismatched target
configurations remain errors. The test uses byte-exact UTF-8 fixture writes,
platform executable suffixes, and closed temporary source files, preserving the
same byte/hash and AST reproduction checks on Windows. To retain local evidence,
set `RUST_MEASURE_NATIVE_EVIDENCE` to a new directory before running the source
measurement suite. `native-result.json` is written only after the fixture's
positive and negative assertions pass; the whole suite must also pass.

A configured job is not evidence of a successful run. Record each actual run,
checkout SHA, target triple, and outcome in the PR validation record. Host-native
fixture success is not a complete Windows/macOS production base/head risk
comparison, and cross-target cfg inspection alone is not native execution.
Production validation runs only the existing risk stage's base/head snapshots,
coverage, measurement, and comparison. It does not run the other Gate stages,
change host network policy, or replay Relay tasks.
