# GH-119 validation: architecture closure and independent adapter proposal

Scope: task 10.5 and final closure documentation only. Starting commit:
`ee1a5ab50ef2e1a77636e8a554326bd7d43dbc85` on `symphony/GH-119`.
The [closure ledger](architecture-closure.md) and
[API evidence](gh-119/predecessor-acceptance.json) establish accepted tasks
0.3–10.4, including the merged/closed GH-118 dependency.

Before edits, `openspec validate language-agnostic-evidence-policy-architecture
--strict` passed. Inspection confirmed every predecessor task was checked and
10.5 was the only unchecked task. The new independent change contains proposal,
design, scenarios and unchecked implementation tasks. No Angular project exists
in this checkout; no Angular code was generated, and build/toolchain acceptance
belongs to the follow-up. No runtime or workflow behavior changed.

## Local commands

Cargo builds and the documentation checker use
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target/gh-119-cargo` to keep build output in this workspace.
Full command logs are retained under `target/quality/gh-119/`; the committed
[validation summary](gh-119/validation-summary.json) retains results and log hashes.

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo nextest run --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --locked` | Passed: 315 tests, 0 skipped |
| `cargo fmt --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml -- --check` | Passed |
| `cargo clippy --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings` | Passed |
| `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/quality/tests -v` | Passed: 207 tests |

| `openspec validate language-agnostic-evidence-policy-architecture --strict` | Passed on final task state |
| `openspec validate typescript-angular-reference-adapter --strict` | Passed |
| `harness-gate config check` | Not applicable: no `.harness-gate/flow.toml` |
| `harness-gate verify --profile ci --all` | Not applicable: no project-local configuration or declared `ci` profile |

No generic configuration was invented. Local test diagnostics include deliberate
measurement-error negative fixtures; the Python suite exited zero. Task 10.5's
proposal creation is validated independently of adapter implementation.

## Acceptance boundary

Generic core capability is distinct from implemented/certified adapters.
Rust remains the sole required release path. TS-01–TS-03 in the
[follow-up design](../../openspec/changes/typescript-angular-reference-adapter/design.md)
record identity and capability mismatches or integration questions explicitly.
All follow-up implementation tasks remain unchecked.

GH-119 required hosted CI remains pending and must pass before closure. The
controller owns CI observation, merge and issue closure. No final architecture
acceptance, cross-ecosystem stability, adapter enablement or physical archival is
claimed at submission.

## Delivery environment

Staging with `git add README.md docs/adr/0040-language-agnostic-evidence-policy.md docs/quality/architecture-closure.md docs/quality/gh-119-validation.md docs/quality/gh-119 openspec/changes/language-agnostic-evidence-policy-architecture openspec/changes/typescript-angular-reference-adapter`
failed with exit 128:
`fatal: Unable to create '/home/gem/symphony-workspaces/GH-119/.git/index.lock': Read-only file system`.
Delivery uses a writable copy of this workspace's Git metadata under
`target/gh-119-git`, with the same work tree, branch and baseline. No other
workspace or source checkout is accessed. This restriction affects staging and
commit metadata, not local validation.
