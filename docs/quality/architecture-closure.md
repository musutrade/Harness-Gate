# Language-agnostic architecture closure record (GH-119)

**Status:** Predecessor tasks 0.3–10.4 accepted; final closure prepared in GH-119.
Task 10.5 creates an independent proposal. This PR's required CI and controller
merge/issue closure remain pending. This record does not claim hosted
CI success for GH-119 or cross-ecosystem stability certification.

## Accepted delivery evidence

Observed through the GitHub API on 2026-09-08: all eight issues are closed as
completed, all associated PRs are merged, and every PR head has a successful
`Required Quality Aggregate`. No returned check has a failed or pending
conclusion. The [machine record](gh-119/predecessor-acceptance.json) pins full
head and merge SHAs, merge/closure times, check counts and aggregate job links.

GH-118's PR #127 merged at `ee1a5ab50ef2e1a77636e8a554326bd7d43dbc85`,
the starting commit of `symphony/GH-119`. Its issue closed at
2026-09-08T05:41:57Z, satisfying GH-119's dependency. Earlier validation records
describe their submission-time pending CI; this ledger supplies subsequent
acceptance evidence without rewriting those historical reports.

## Implemented capability and certification boundary

| Surface | Implemented / accepted scope | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic core | Development-only project/subject model, normalized evidence, collector runner, policy, baseline/debt/ratchet, contract aggregation and JSON reporting | Generic contracts do not execute or certify arbitrary language tools; illustrative TOML is not implemented configuration |
| Rust reference adapter | Retained-candidate projection, native/generic compatibility, advisory shadow CI; [defined retrospective equivalence window](rust-equivalence-acceptance.md) accepted via GH-118 | Two retained Linux Rust runs plus negative fixtures; legacy coverage/traceability stages retain native results; no new baseline, hosted soak or wider platform claim |
| TypeScript/Angular | Synthetic examples; [independent draft proposal](../../openspec/changes/typescript-angular-reference-adapter/proposal.md) | No real adapter implemented or certified; no default adapter enabled |
| Python/Java and cross-component tools | Synthetic evidence/model/contract fixtures | No real ecosystem or contract-tool adapter certified |

The Rust `Quality Coverage and Critical Paths` and stable
`Required Quality Aggregate` remain the sole required release path. Generic
shadow outcomes do not replace or waive required results. Series remain
noninterchangeable; collectors measure and policy decides; integrity and
unavailable evidence fail closed as recorded in
[ADR-0040](../adr/0040-language-agnostic-evidence-policy.md).

## Final task and remaining acceptance

Task 10.5 creates the separate
[`typescript-angular-reference-adapter` change](../../openspec/changes/typescript-angular-reference-adapter/proposal.md),
including a runnable-fixture plan, real collection, generic policy/ratchet and
contract acceptance scenarios. Its implementation tasks remain unchecked.
The [mismatch register](../../openspec/changes/typescript-angular-reference-adapter/design.md#architectural-mismatch-register)
records reduced-identity negotiation (TS-01), multi-source template identity
(TS-02), and per-record capability scope (TS-03). Unresolved scope stays
uncertified; required core changes need explicit review and evidence.

The [GH-119 validation record](gh-119-validation.md) records final local checks.
GH-119 contains closure documentation and proposal work only, with no runtime,
workflow, branch-protection, measurement or baseline changes. After this PR's
required CI passes, the controller owns merge and issue closure. The named
architecture directory remains available for the required strict validation;
archival is not claimed by this submission. Acceptance closes the bounded v1
architecture work, while stability across ecosystems remains conditional on
the real second-ecosystem follow-up.
