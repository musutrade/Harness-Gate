# Optimized CI execution model

This is the current operating guide for `optimize-ci-execution-topology` after
GH-169's rollbacks. Earlier stage records describe experiments; this guide and
the [closure evidence](closure.md) distinguish retained behavior from those
experiments. The [Engineering Policy](../../engineering-policy.md),
[ADR-0039](../../adr/0039-required-risk-and-traceability-gates.md) and
[ADR-0040](../../adr/0040-language-agnostic-evidence-policy.md) still govern.
CRAP <= 30, coverage thresholds, critical-path requirements, measurement
identities, debt/ratchet rules and Rust decision/release authority are unchanged.

## Execution and ownership

The [CI workflow](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) fans out Linux tests and
schema sync, full native macOS/Windows tests, security audit, format, Clippy,
release build, quality coverage/risk/critical paths, CLI contracts, docs
consistency, release governance and quality-script tests on every PR.
Push additionally requires native builds/contracts, Code Coverage and Quality
Performance Baseline. The [frozen event matrix](baseline.md) and
[aggregate contract](aggregate.md) specify the exact child mapping.

`Required Quality Aggregate` keeps its exact name and `always()` condition.
Its only work is checkout, Python setup and fail-closed evaluation of `needs`.
Missing, malformed, failed, cancelled or unexpectedly skipped required children
block it; only existing event-specific push-only exemptions are allowed.
It does not compile, test or collect replacement measurements.

Quality Coverage and Critical Paths owns collection for each series. Generic
Quality Shadow verifies and projects that retained evidence; it remains advisory.
Base/head snapshots and isolated critical-path targets remain distinct. No
downstream recollection, cross-platform substitution or cross-job product binary
sharing was introduced. Tests, dev contracts, release builds, Clippy and
instrumented measurements retain their own compilation semantics and parallel
scheduling. Contracts always ask locked Cargo to establish executable freshness.
Docs run all eleven locked Cargo operations, reusing Cargo's within-job target;
the build-once docs experiment was reverted without losing any checks.

## Tool versions

| Tool | Required version | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cargo-nextest | 0.9.143 | Full tests, quality collection, benchmarks and baseline refresh |
| cargo-llvm-cov | 0.9.0 | Quality collection |
| cargo-audit | 0.22.2 | Security and release audits; deny-warnings preserved |

The [installer](../../../.github/actions/install-ci-tool/action.yml) pins
`taiki-e/install-action` to `d438492cf8a250514fa2d34b30bc3c0dc37c65ff`, enables
checksums and verifies effective versions through the consuming Cargo command.
Missing platform/version binaries use the explicit locked source fallback;
download/checksum failures fail the job. There is no installed-tool cache or
cache-hit exemption from verification. See [tool setup](tool-setup.md) for
platform details and the pin-update procedure.

This is not a fully pinned environment: Rust remains `stable`, Python `3.x`,
runner images use `*-latest`, and other actions retain their existing version
tags. Push-only tarpaulin still uses its existing unversioned locked source
install. Retained effective tool identities, rather than those moving labels,
describe an actual measurement. Changing these remaining conventions is outside
this documentation issue.

## Cache and artifact trust boundaries

The [Cargo state action](../../../.github/actions/cargo-state/action.yml) selects
`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/target/ci/<OS>/<architecture>/<class>` and requires Cargo
metadata to agree. Collector-owned fresh instrumentation targets override that
default. Download caches contain only the resolved Cargo home's registry
index/archives and git databases, keyed by
`cargo-sources-v1-<OS>-<architecture>-<lock SHA-256>`.
They contain no tools, compiled products or authoritative measurement evidence.
They are disposable acceleration state within GitHub cache isolation; restoring
a cache grants no quality or release authority.

**Compiled target caching is disabled for every caller.** The retained action
implementation is experimental infrastructure, not an enabled optimization.
Its identity includes compiler, Cargo, OS, architecture, lock/configuration,
flags, class and profiles; weakening those boundaries to manufacture cache hits
is not an accepted remedy. Instrumented quality, performance and ordinary
targets are never exchanged as equivalent measurements.

The quality producer seals `ci-artifact.json` with repository/workflow/producer,
checkout SHA, run/attempt, platform, configuration and effective tool identity,
plus exact file inventory and SHA-256s. The manifest digest travels independently
through a producer job output. The consumer downloads the named current
run/attempt artifact and validates that digest, identity and inventory before
existing candidate/projection policy checks. Hidden evidence is included;
mutable build/snapshot trees, symlinks and extra/missing/changed files are rejected.
Hash integrity is not producer authentication and cannot authorize untrusted PR
workflow code or release publishing. Linux Build's resolved binary upload is
informational. Failed collection can upload diagnostics via `always()`, but
unsealed diagnostics are not valid input for successful projection.

## Diagnosis

| Symptom | Evidence to inspect | Recovery preserving required assurance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tool installation/version failure | Resolve/install/verify steps, selected platform, checksum/fallback reason, expected and actual version | Repair the pinned installation or reviewed pin contract; rerun the required job. Never skip its gate. |
| Unexpected cache miss or target mismatch | `cargo-state-<job>-<OS>-<architecture>-<run>-<attempt>` artifact, `target/quality/cache/*.json`, Cargo metadata and cache action logs | Confirm resolved Cargo home/target and lock identity. Source-cache misses can download normally. Remove obsolete disposable cache state or revise its namespace with review; keep target caching disabled. |
| Missing or rejected quality artifact | Producer collection/seal outcome, manifest-digest output, artifact run/attempt name, `ci-artifact.json`, consumer expected identity | Repair producer or transport and rerun. Never reseal substituted content in the consumer, use a stale run, bypass verification or recollect a replacement series. |
| Projection fails after valid transport | `artifact-validation.json` in Generic Shadow evidence and retained candidate/policy reports | Investigate the existing semantic failure; transport success does not imply policy success. |
| Aggregate is red | Event, complete `needs` results and first failed required child | Fix that child's failure. Do not alter requiredness or add heavy recovery work to the aggregate. |

## Hosted comparison and remaining work

The [hosted comparison](after-state.md) retains three baseline runs and two
post-optimization runs under the same normalization, with source inputs,
job/step timestamps and log audit. These samples precede the final rollbacks;
the [rollback commit's green run](closure.md) proves required-CI acceptance of
that code but is not a new matched performance cohort.

| Measure | Before median (range) | After median (range) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Developer critical path, seconds | 903 (846–1141) | 878.5 (875–882) |
| Total runner wall minutes | 40.7 (37.5–43.2) | 39.3 (38.3–40.3) |
| Linux runner minutes | 28.6 (28.2–33.3) | 26.9 (26.2–27.5) |
| macOS runner minutes | 4.3 (3.2–4.9) | 5.1 (4.8–5.3) |
| Windows runner minutes | 5.7 (5.7–7.5) | 7.4 (7.3–7.5) |
| Summed tool-install seconds | 423 (392–453) | 12 (12–12) |
| Quality collection seconds | 600 (560–821) | 836.5 (828–845) |

Critical path measures PR workflow run creation to aggregate completion, including scheduling
and waiting. Runner cost sums active job wall time, separated by OS, excluding
queue time and billing multipliers. Concurrent setup seconds are work, not
elapsed developer wait. Fewer jobs alone demonstrates neither improvement.

Pinned tools removed 411 median summed install seconds; audit job wall time fell
from 193 to 16.5 seconds. Quality collection remained the last required child in
every primary sample and absorbed much of the setup saving. Latency and total
runner ranges overlap; native runner work increased. These small, unmatched
cohorts establish no causal latency improvement, guaranteed percentage or billed
savings. Remaining bottlenecks are instrumented base/head/isolated collection,
native full tests and independent compilation profiles. Artifact steps were
approximately flat (10 vs 10.5 median seconds); retain their integrity checks.
Nested action times already included in setup/cleanup must not be double counted.

GH-169 disabled compiled caches after seven misses and zero hits per primary
run (41.964/32.908 summed restore/save seconds), and restored docs Cargo calls
after 43-second operation times versus baseline median 42. Future experiments
need hosted evidence for both developer wait and runner work, preserving the
same measurement identities. Revert neutral/worse or ambiguous optimizations
individually; never recover speed by weakening required assurance.

## Separate policy and product changes

Any future risk-driven conditional cross-platform execution is a **separate
normative Engineering Policy delta** requiring explicit policy review and
independent compatibility/negative evidence. Path filters, sampling, scheduled
certification or advisory replacement of required native tests were not
implemented here. Full macOS and Windows tests remain PR-required; this change
provides no implicit authorization to reduce platform assurance.

Product workflow integration (`quality.toml`, verify collector orchestration,
baseline UX and preset quality integration) remains the independent
`integrate-generic-quality-into-project-workflow` follow-up.
