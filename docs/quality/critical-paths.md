# Critical-path source evidence

`tools/quality/critical_paths.toml` uses rule `critical-path-source-v2`. Each stable
ID identifies a Rust function, exact source range and file SHA-256, an exact nextest
binary/test identity, its test function and assertions, executable line/column
probes, and a reviewed observable. Platform exclusions have a reason, owner and
review date. The independent `critical_paths_policy.json` fixes the six mandatory
IDs and their applicability. Removing one fails before computing the denominator.

Commit source changes, then collect and evaluate:

```sh
python3 tools/quality/critical_paths.py --collect \
  --evidence target/quality/critical-path-runs/bundle.json \
  --output target/quality/critical-paths.json
```

The collector requires cargo-nextest, cargo-llvm-cov (CI pins 0.9.0), and Rust's
llvm-tools-preview component. It reserves `target/build/llvm-cov-target` for serial
instrumented runs; do not run another coverage command there during collection.
An atomic collection lock rejects overlapping collectors. A crash leaves the lock
for inspection before manual removal. Each row cleans prior instrumentation,
executes exactly one test with nextest JSON-plus 0.1, and exports raw LLVM JSON.
Child CLI processes inherit instrumentation. Every command, exit status, test event
stream and coverage export is retained under a unique run directory, including
failed runs. Only a completed collection writes the bundle declaration.

The bundle binds inventory, all crate source/test/build inputs, host target,
commit, rule, tool versions and artifact hashes. Local source bytes must match the
commit. A row cannot reuse another run's artifacts. Missing, modified, stale,
mixed-target, mixed-commit, skipped, cancelled or failed evidence fails closed.
Names-only lists and aggregate module coverage are no longer accepted. CI's
existing matrix step invokes this collector and uploads its raw artifacts.

LLVM function envelopes must match the reviewed source function. Each probe needs
a positive counter in its most specific executable region; an outer function hit
cannot substitute for an unexecuted failure branch. Changes to function locations,
file contents or observable assertions require an explicit inventory update and
fresh evidence. Inspect the source and LLVM regions when updating columns: Rust
keywords such as `break` and `let` may have no executable region of their own.

Passing assertions bind the observed behavior to the isolated source execution;
the tool does not infer assertion semantics. Review assertion changes together with
the test and helper source. The JSON fixture runs the actual CLI against unrelated,
numeric and ambiguous successful-command output, then checks failure status,
`RESULT_PARSE_FAILURE`, and incomplete parser evidence. Report tampering and lease
ownership fixtures inject actual boundary failures. Fake Docker/Podman ownership
evidence makes no real-container or daemon claim. The process-tree fixture checks
for a delayed descendant marker; it is not proof of complete descendant containment.

Every applicable mandatory row must pass even if the overall percentage exceeds
95%. At least 95% of all applicable rows must pass. Unix-only cancellation and JSON
CLI fixtures are reviewed exclusions on Windows; Linux and macOS require them.
No platform becomes exempt merely because a runtime dependency is unavailable.

This implements OpenSpec `strict-json-results-and-risk-based-quality-gates` tasks
7.1–7.4 and operationalizes the failure boundaries in
[ADR 0034](../adr/0034-fail-closed-trust-boundaries.md) and
[ADR 0038](../adr/0038-post-remediation-hardening.md). Broader quality aggregation
and baseline adoption remain tasks 8.x.
