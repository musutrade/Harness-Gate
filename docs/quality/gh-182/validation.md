# GH-182 trusted baseline validation

Scope: OpenSpec `integrate-generic-quality-into-project-workflow`, tasks 4.1–4.4;
[ADR-0044](../../adr/0044-trusted-quality-baselines.md).

Runtime logs are retained under `target/quality/gh-182/`. Rust and embedded Rust
checks use `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/gh182-cargo`, `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`,
`CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0`, and `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0`.

| Command | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo nextest run --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --locked` | 354 passed, 0 skipped | `nextest.log` |
| `cargo fmt --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml -- --check` | Passed | `fmt.log` |
| `cargo clippy --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings` | Passed | `clippy.log` |
| `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/quality/tests -v` | 329 passed | `python.log` |
| `python3 tools/quality/docs_consistency.py --output target/quality/docs-consistency.json` | Passed | `docs.log`, output JSON |
| `openspec validate integrate-generic-quality-into-project-workflow --strict` | Passed | `openspec.log` |
| `python3 tools/quality/fixtures/workflow/baseline/acceptance.py --harness-gate /tmp/gh182-cargo/debug/harness-gate --output target/quality/gh-182/baseline-validated` | 39 cases passed | `baseline-validated.log`, `baseline-validated/acceptance.json` |

The committed [corpus summary](baseline-corpus.json) records each expected
resolution outcome. The integration test invokes the same fixture through the
shipped CLI. Cases cover exact Git/ref/merge-base and retained-artifact resolution,
unknown ecosystem with a custom series and supported numeric custom capability,
rename/move inherited debt, worsening debt, missing required/optional baselines,
stale run/commit, changed configuration/tool, incompatible series, corrupt hashes,
unsafe paths, and unchanged dirty working-tree/index bytes. Resolved inputs match
the direct evaluator's report and exit status; custom metric transport does not
extend the evaluator's certified metric registry.

Final production coverage passes: **12,943 / 14,611 lines (88.584%)**, with every
blocking production boundary passing its unchanged threshold. The final
instrumented nextest run also passed all 354 tests. Commands, with the workspace
coverage target described below:

```bash
cargo llvm-cov nextest --package harness-gate --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --locked --test-threads 2 --no-fail-fast --json --output-path target/quality/gh-182/coverage.raw.json
cargo llvm-cov report --package harness-gate --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --lcov --output-path target/quality/gh-182/coverage.lcov
cargo llvm-cov report --package harness-gate --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --cobertura --output-path target/quality/gh-182/coverage.cobertura.xml
python3 tools/quality/coverage.py --production --raw target/quality/gh-182/coverage.raw.json --lcov target/quality/gh-182/coverage.lcov --output target/quality/gh-182/production.json
```

Logs: `coverage-retry.log`, `coverage-export.log`, `coverage-production.log`.
The [coverage summary](coverage-summary.json) retains aggregate and boundary
results. Hosted source risk comparison and Required Quality Aggregate are pending;
local production coverage alone does not establish their status.

The default Cargo target `/home/gem/cargo-target` is read-only in this workspace:
`cargo check --manifest-path tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --locked` failed opening
`debug/.cargo-build-lock` with `Read-only file system (os error 30)`.
Using `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/gh182-cargo` fixed that restriction. The first full
nextest build then failed before test execution with `Disk quota exceeded (os
error 122)`. Its log is `nextest-quota.log`. Cargo's own clean command removed
this task's build artifacts. Subsequent Rust builds also set `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`,
`CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0` and `CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0` to reduce disk use.

An initial docs check without the writable Cargo environment could not run its
embedded Cargo example/schema checks. It also found the then-unwritten validation
document. The final docs check uses the same writable Cargo environment.

`harness-gate config check` and `harness-gate verify --profile ci --all` are **not
applicable**, not passed: this source checkout has no `.harness-gate/flow.toml`
declaring a `ci` profile. No synthetic project configuration was added.

The first coverage target in `/tmp/gh182-coverage` also exhausted its disk quota
(`coverage.log`). Cargo cleaned only this task's target. The final instrumented
run uses `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$PWD/target/gh182-coverage` with the same other Rust
environment settings. No coverage or risk threshold was changed.

An additional `cargo llvm-cov nextest --package harness-gate --manifest-path
tools/harness-gate/Cargo.toml --locked --json --output-path
target/quality/gh-182/coverage.raw.json` run hit the existing cancellation test's
15-second startup deadline (`verification_cleanup_cancel_and_report_precedence_retains_resource_evidence`:
`task did not start`). `coverage-final.log` retains that failure. The required
uninstrumented nextest run passed that test. Final coverage uses `--test-threads 2 --no-fail-fast`; the cancellation test passes at that concurrency.

Local staging is blocked: `git add` failed with
`Unable to create .../.git/index.lock: Read-only file system`. Publication uses
GitHub's Git tree/commit/ref API on `symphony/GH-182`, preserving the prepared
parent commit and publishing exactly the validated workspace files. Local Git
metadata remains unchanged; the handoff identifies the actual remote commit.

Hosted Required Quality Aggregate is **CI pending**, owned by the controller.
This change does not alter required jobs, measurement thresholds, historical
baseline acceptance, or mark the remaining OpenSpec tasks complete.
