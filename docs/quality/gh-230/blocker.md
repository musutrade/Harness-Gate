# GH-230 native acceptance dependency wait

Status: environment-blocked before P6/P7 implementation, 2026-09-11.
No scoped task is complete. Relevant Engineering Policy semantics are unchanged.

## Accepted predecessor

GitHub API reads confirmed GH-229 closed as completed and PR #235 merged as
`e24aeb351168610c00c14032a473fad61659ec2b`. That commit is both this assigned
`symphony/GH-230` branch's HEAD and current remote main. The controller's
[delivery receipt](https://github.com/musutrade/Harness-Gate/issues/229#issuecomment-5630432249)
confirms predecessor acceptance. This is not a wait for predecessor review.

## Reproduced environment failure

The assigned checkout has no provisioned native runtime or rustc-dev archive.
The installed compiler reports rustc 1.97.1, commit
`8bab26f4f68e0e26f0bb7960be334d5b520ea452`, LLVM 22.1.6;
`rustup component list --installed` includes llvm-tools but not rustc-dev.
No historical workspace was accessed or used as an input.

Executed from the assigned workspace:

```sh
mkdir -p target/gh-230/logs target/gh-230/tmp
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target/gh-230/cargo" TMPDIR="$PWD/target/gh-230/tmp" python3 tools/quality/rust-native-driver/bootstrap.py --sysroot "$(rustc --print sysroot)" --output target/gh-230/native-driver > target/gh-230/logs/bootstrap.stdout 2> target/gh-230/logs/bootstrap.stderr
```

The execution tool rejected network access with:

```text
exec_command failed: ProcessFailed { message: "Network access to \"https://static.rust-lang.org:443\" was blocked by policy." }
```

No process exit code was returned by the tool. The original
[stderr](bootstrap.stderr) ends with
`urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error Remote end closed connection without response>`.
No archive was downloaded and no native driver was built. No alternate download
route or global toolchain mutation was attempted.

## Resume input and scope

The controller/operator must provision the original pinned archive into this
assigned workspace through an authorized mechanism:

- File: `rustc-dev-1.97.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz`
- Source: `https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/2026-07-16/rustc-dev-1.97.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz`
- Expected SHA-256: `0109304e1995cce9e3362208f5d4ec0944e52a2ddfbc0a85d4ce5bea5d3081ab`

These are the accepted bootstrap pins, not bytes verified during this attempt.
Resume using bootstrap's `--archive` option and a fresh output directory; keep
the original failed directory and logs. All builds and captures must remain
workspace-local. Existing P6.1/P6.2/P7.1/P7.2/P7.3 estimates remain at most three
focused hours each; this attempt did not start their implementation.

The installed entry still rejects all collect requests because the reviewed
compatibility matrix is empty. Fresh native positive measurements, Core
integration, clean-host installation, re-export retention, negative acceptance
and costs remain unproven. Historical GH-228 bytes and synthetic tests cannot
certify this host. No supported matrix row or task checkbox was added.

Local baseline check results are recorded in [checks.json](checks.json) and
[validation](validation.md). They do not resolve the native prerequisite.
No PR or completion handoff declaration is issued for this unfinished work.
No tag, release, Arc-Admin write or GH-215 enablement was attempted.

## Retry prerequisite recheck

The subsequent unattended invocation reconfirmed PR #235 merged and GH-229
closed through GitHub API reads. HEAD and origin/main still match the accepted
predecessor above. The [local prerequisite recheck](prerequisite-recheck.json)
records exact read-only commands and results: rustc-dev is still not installed,
the native runtime environment inputs are unset, and a workspace-only scan found
no rustc-dev archive or native driver. The scan did not follow symlinks or access
another workspace. The original network policy denial remains unresolved; no
download retry or alternate route was attempted. This remains an environment
dependency wait. No implementation or task completion was added, and unchanged
baseline validation was not repeated. The original evidence is preserved.

The next retry at 2026-09-11 06:50 UTC again confirmed the controller acceptance
receipt and remote main at the same predecessor merge. The additional
[prerequisite recheck](prerequisite-recheck-2.json) preserves the exact local
commands and results without replacing the earlier evidence: rustc-dev remains
absent, runtime inputs remain unset, and the workspace-only scan still finds no
archive or native driver. The download denial has not been resolved; no network
retry, implementation, repeated baseline checks, PR or completion declaration
was attempted. Resume still requires the pinned original archive specified above.
