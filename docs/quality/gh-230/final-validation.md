# GH-230 final local validation

See [acceptance](acceptance.md) for native evidence and scope. Commands below ran
against integrated main `ee544690662645806cda7dd4cd2c9192566f7929` plus this PR's
source edits. Hosted required CI and controller acceptance remain pending.

Proxy variables were removed for local servers. The existing read-only `.git`
necessitated workspace-local continuation metadata for integration/commit/push;
only documentation metadata commands received its `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`.
Fixture test commands did not inherit these overrides. All build, test temporary
and capture paths are workspace-local. No source checkout or another workspace
was accessed or changed.

The [validation archive](final-validation-logs.tar.gz) contains exact environment,
command/exit records and full original/corrected logs, with an
[archive receipt](final-validation-archive.json). Genuine failures are retained:

- Initial nextest: 38 passed, 1 failed, 353 not run. A temporary directory nested
  in this checkout discovered its enclosing Git repository in `scope_without_git`.
  Adding the workspace-local Git ceiling fixed isolation; full rerun passed.
- Initial quality suite: 439 tests, one failure in the Python boundary corpus;
  the new delivery module needed an inventory row. The B-class measurement-only
  inventory was updated, focused corpus checks passed, then all 439 passed.
  Frozen C/D semantic hashes were unchanged.
- An intermediate quality rerun was interrupted after spotting Git metadata
  overrides inappropriate for fixture repositories. The corrected script removes
  those overrides and completed successfully; interruption is not a pass.
- Initial documentation command reported examples/migration/schema failures;
  its subprocess diagnostics were not emitted. The retained report is a failure,
  not inferred proof of a specific root cause. The corrected workspace build/temp
  and proxy environment command passed, then was rerun after final documentation.

- The final documentation pass initially found two links to the validation archive
  before it had been written. Creating the real archive and receipt resolved them;
  the failed link report remains retained.

Earlier failure records under this directory are preserved, including superseded
release and container prerequisite failures. No skipped native test, synthetic
negative, archive-only replay or checkout-built Core is used to establish the
final clean-container positive result. Required CI is delegated to the controller
through the normal PR handoff; P8 completion is not claimed here.
