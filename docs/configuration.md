# harness-gate schema v2 configuration reference

This is the English reference for .harness-gate/flow.toml, secret scanning,
and architecture auditing. The [JSON Schema catalog](../schema/README.md)
lists every machine-readable contract. The Chinese reference is
[configuration.zh-CN.md](configuration.zh-CN.md).

Harness-Gate is data-driven: projects add commands, components, profiles,
parsers, and services in TOML without changing the Rust engine. JSON Schema
checks structure; config check also checks interpolation, paths, references,
and resource safety.

## 1. Loading and commands

The default file is .harness-gate/flow.toml. The CLI searches from the
current directory toward its parents, or accepts explicit paths:

    harness-gate --project-root /path/to/project config check
    harness-gate --project-root /path/to/project \
      --config config/ci-flow.toml config check
    harness-gate config check --format json
    harness-gate config print --resolved
    harness-gate schema export

The project root and configuration must stay inside the checkout. Absolute
paths, .. traversal, and symlinks that resolve outside the project are
rejected. `${NAME}` requires an existing variable; `${NAME:-default}` supplies
a default. Interpolation runs before TOML parsing and is not recursive.
paths.audit_config must instead be a literal repository-relative path so an
external environment cannot replace the audit policy.

config check runs before services, child processes, or reports are created.
JSON diagnostics contain stable HGCFG-* IDs, field paths, a reason, and a
remediation hint. Interpolated secrets, connection strings, and template
contents are not emitted.

## 2. Editor schema association

schema/flow.schema.json is the local schema for .harness-gate/flow.toml.
Run harness-gate schema export whenever the Rust configuration model changes;
CI checks that the generated file is committed.

VS Code with Even Better TOML:

    {
      "evenBetterToml.schema.associations": {
        "./schema/flow.schema.json": [".harness-gate/flow.toml"]
      }
    }

Taplo:

    [[schema.associations]]
    url = "./schema/flow.schema.json"
    include = [".harness-gate/flow.toml"]

Editors catch structural errors first. Run config check --format json for
runtime-aware diagnostics.

## 3. Names, paths, and placeholders

IDs for projects, components, profiles, steps, parsers, services, doctor
checks, and aliases must be non-empty lowercase ASCII names containing only
letters, digits, ., -, and _. Environment variable names use uppercase
letters, digits, and _. A program is a bare executable from PATH; it
cannot contain / or a backslash.

Repository paths are non-empty relative paths without parent traversal.

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| {root} | Absolute project root. |
| {reports} | Absolute report directory. |
| {audit_config} | Absolute audit rules path. |
| {<alias>} | Absolute path from [paths.aliases.<alias>]. |
| {host_port} | Random host port allocated for a managed service. |

A step cwd must be exactly {root} or one declared alias. Declare an alias for
a subdirectory instead of adding a suffix to cwd.

## 4. Top-level structure

    version = 2

    [project]
    # ...

    [paths]
    # ...

    [policy]
    # ...

    [execution]
    # parallel = false
    # max_parallel = 4

    [notifications]
    # [[notifications.webhooks]]
    # ...

    [[doctor.checks]]
    # ...

    [services.example]
    # ...

    [parsers.example]
    # ...

    [scope]
    # unmatched = "fail"

    [[scope.rules]]
    # ...

    [[steps]]
    # ...

| Section | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| version | Yes | Must be 2. |
| [project] | Yes | Project ID and default profiles. |
| [paths] | Yes | Reports, audit rules, and aliases. |
| [policy] | No | Required steps and expiring waivers. |
| [execution] | No | Dependency-aware scheduling and retries. |
| [doctor] | No | Local environment checks. |
| [services.*] | No | Environment or managed container services. |
| [parsers.*] | No | Test-result parsing. |
| [scope] | Yes | Changed-path matching behavior. |
| [[steps]] | Yes | External commands or built-in gates. |
| [report_templates] | No | Optional HTML and JUnit output. |
| [notifications] | No | Optional HTTP(S) notifications. |

Unknown fields fail parsing rather than being silently ignored.

## 5. Project and paths

    [project]
    name = "orders-api"
    default_profile = "full"
    hook_profile = "hook"

    [paths]
    reports = ".harness-gate/reports"
    audit_config = ".harness-gate/audit.toml"
    secrets_config = ".harness-gate/secrets.toml"

    [paths.aliases.api]
    path = "services/api"
    env = "HARNESS_GATE_API_DIR"

project.name, default_profile, and hook_profile are required IDs. Profiles are
created by the profiles set on steps, and both project profiles must be
referenced by at least one step.

paths.reports holds JSON, Markdown, optional HTML/JUnit output, and invocation
evidence. paths.audit_config points to audit rules. paths.secrets_config
defaults to .harness-gate/secrets.toml. Alias env may override an alias path
for one invocation. root, reports, audit_config, and host_port are reserved
placeholder names.

REPORT_DIR (compatibility alias, warning until 2027-03-01) or
HARNESS_GATE_REPORTS overrides paths.reports; HARNESS_GATE_SECRETS_CONFIG
overrides paths.secrets_config. PROJECT_ROOT, HARNESS_GATE_CONFIG,
AUDITOR_CONFIG, and HARNESS_GATE_AUDIT_CONFIG do not participate in discovery.
Select a project explicitly with --project-root and --config.

### Invocation inputs

Each invocation records an input mode, project identity, source identity,
execution root, and configuration digest. Ordinary verify reads the working
tree. scope --staged and hook materialize the complete Git index into a private
temporary snapshot, run every gate there, and remove it afterwards.

Steps default to input = "snapshot" ("staged" is a compatibility alias):

| Input | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| snapshot | Read from the immutable invocation root; hooks use the complete staged snapshot. |
| repository | Read the original checkout. This is an explicit compatibility capability for commands that need Git metadata. |

Secret scan, architecture audit, and scope always use the invocation input.
Machine results include input_mode, source_identity, execution_root, and
configuration_digest.

## 6. Execution, retries, and shards

    [execution]
    parallel = true
    max_parallel = 4

    [execution.retries.api.tests]
    max_attempts = 3
    backoff_ms = 250
    retryable = ["timeout", "exit"]

    [execution.shards.api.tests]
    index = 0
    total = 2

parallel defaults to false; max_parallel defaults to 4 when enabled and must be
1..=64. Dependencies, service locks, and the built-in secret/audit order remain
authoritative. Results are printed in stable plan order. A failed dependency
prevents its descendants from running; reports list them in skipped_steps and
keep the overall result failed.

Retry policies are keyed by step ID. max_attempts is 1..=5; retryable is the
closed set cancelled, timeout, parser, and exit. Results include every attempt,
retry count, flaky state, parser completeness, and shard identity.

### Versioned runner contract

    [[steps]]
    id = "backend.tests"
    label = "backend tests"
    component = "backend"
    profiles = ["full"]
    program = "cargo"
    args = ["test", "--manifest-path", "backend/Cargo.toml"]
    cwd = "{root}"
    log = "backend_tests.log"
    timeout_secs = 300
    runner = { version = 1, kind = "cargo-test", threads = 4,
               result_format = "junit", isolation = "schema-per-worker" }

| Field | Required | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| version | Yes | Runner contract version, currently 1. |
| kind | Yes | Runner ID; cargo-test requires program = cargo. |
| threads | No | 1..=256; cargo-test adds -- --test-threads N. |
| threads_env | No | Thread-count variable; required for non-cargo runners when threads are set. |
| args | No | Runner-specific arguments. |
| args_position | No | Zero-based insertion index; omitted means append. |
| result_format | No | regex, junit, trx, or json; default regex. |
| isolation | Yes | shared, schema-per-worker, or database-per-worker. |

threads > 1 cannot use shared isolation. With global parallelism, external
steps must declare runner isolation. Worker identity is passed through reserved
HARNESS_GATE_ISOLATION_* variables and cleaned up after the invocation.

## 7. Policy and waivers

    [policy]
    required_steps = ["api.format", "api.tests"]

    [[policy.waivers]]
    id = "incident-123"
    step = "api.tests"
    scope = "api"
    risk = "medium"
    reason = "upstream fixture unavailable"
    owner = "team-api"
    approved_by = "security-reviewer"
    created_at = "2026-08-30T00:00:00Z"
    expires_at = "2026-09-02T00:00:00Z"
    compensating_control = "manual smoke test attached to incident"

Every required_steps ID must exist exactly once in [[steps]]. Waivers require an
owner, approver, reason, compensating control, and RFC3339 creation and expiry
timestamps. Expired, revoked, out-of-scope, or self-approved waivers fail
before execution. A valid waiver is reported as WAIVED, not PASS.

## 8. Doctor checks

    [[doctor.checks]]
    id = "tool.git"
    label = "git"
    required = true
    timeout_secs = 15
    help = "install Git and ensure it is on PATH"
    kind = "command"
    program = "git"
    args = ["--version"]

Common fields are id, label, required (default true), timeout_secs (1..=300,
default 15), and optional help.

| Kind | Fields | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| command | program, args | Command must exit 0. |
| path | path, path_type | Check any path, file, or directory. |
| glob | pattern | Pattern must match at least one path. |
| env | name | Variable must exist. |
| env-or-file | env, path, contains | Variable exists, or a file has a line beginning with contains. |
| git-config | key, expected | Git value must equal expected. |
| git-remotes | none | Validate Git remote configuration. |
| version | program, args, path, trim_prefix | Compare command output with a version file. |
| service | service | Check an environment or managed service. |

path_type is any, file, or directory and defaults to any. Use
harness-gate doctor --strict in CI when warnings must fail the job.

### Lease and orphan cleanup

Managed Docker/Podman services and invocation directories use JSON leases under
<reports>/leases/. Lease schema 2 contains project identity, deterministic
resource ID and kind, invocation ID, process identity, creation/heartbeat/
expiry times, runtime labels, and the immutable runtime object ID.

A lease is a resource claim, not delete authorization. Cleanup re-inspects a
container and compares filename, project, resource, invocation, ownership
labels, and immutable object ID. Missing or changed evidence, inspect errors,
old schemas, and cross-project records leave resources untouched.

    # Observe only; do not stop containers or delete leases.
    harness-gate cleanup --dry-run --json

    # Reclaim dead or expired Harness-Gate leases.
    harness-gate cleanup --json

Cleanup writes cleanup.json. Unknown markers, malformed records, and active
owners are never reclaimed; a stop failure leaves the lease for a later retry.

## 9. Services

Environment services forward values supplied by CI or a secret manager:

    [services.test-redis]
    kind = "environment"
    source_env = "CI_REDIS_URL"
    inject_env = "TEST_REDIS_URL"

Managed services use an existing local OCI image and never pull implicitly:

    [services.test-postgres]
    kind = "docker"
    runtime = "docker" # or podman
    image = "postgres:16-alpine"
    image_env = "HARNESS_GATE_POSTGRES_IMAGE"
    external_env = "TEST_DATABASE_URL"
    inject_env = "TEST_DATABASE_URL"
    external_value_policy = "isolated-postgres"
    startup_timeout_secs = 30
    timeout_env = "HARNESS_GATE_DATABASE_TIMEOUT_SECS"
    container_port = 5432
    environment = { POSTGRES_USER = "test", POSTGRES_PASSWORD = "test", POSTGRES_DB = "app_test" }
    healthcheck = ["pg_isready", "-U", "test", "-d", "app_test"]
    connection = "postgres://test:test@127.0.0.1:{host_port}/app_test"

runtime is docker by default or compatible podman. image, inject_env,
startup_timeout_secs, container_port, healthcheck, and connection are
required. image_env, external_env, timeout_env, and environment are optional.
external_value_policy is none or isolated-postgres.

The isolated-postgres policy accepts only loopback connections to a test
database with the configured test suffix and credentials. Service injection
names must be unique within a step and cannot collide with runner thread
variables or remove_env.

## 10. Parsers

    [parsers.rust]
    kind = "regex"
    patterns = ['(?m)^running ([0-9]+) tests?$']
    capture = 1
    minimum = 1

    [parsers.junit]
    kind = "junit"
    minimum = 1

    [parsers.dotnet]
    kind = "trx"
    minimum = 1

    [parsers.json-results]
    kind = "json"
    count_path = "results"
    minimum = 1

regex counts a capture group; junit reads JUnit XML; trx reads Visual Studio
TRX XML; and json reads an array or numeric field at count_path (or discovers
common result arrays when omitted). minimum defaults to 1. Empty, malformed,
partial, or ambiguous results fail closed.

## 11. Scope rules

    [scope]
    unmatched = "fail" # fail, all, or ignore

    [[scope.rules]]
    patterns = ["services/api/**"]
    components = ["api"]

unmatched defaults to fail. all runs every component and ignore drops unmatched
paths. Rules map Git paths to component IDs and the selected set is recorded in
the machine result.

## 12. Steps and built-in gates

    [[steps]]
    id = "api.tests"
    label = "API tests"
    component = "api"
    profiles = ["full", "ci"]
    program = "cargo"
    args = ["test", "--manifest-path", "services/api/Cargo.toml"]
    cwd = "{root}"
    log = "api_tests.log"
    timeout_secs = 300
    parser = "rust"
    services = ["test-postgres"]
    depends_on = ["api.format"]
    input = "snapshot"
    remove_env = ["UNSAFE_TEST_MODE"]

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | Yes | Globally unique step ID. |
| label | Yes | Human-readable report label. |
| component | Yes | Component selected by scope. |
| profiles | Yes | At least one profile. |
| program | Yes | Bare executable name. |
| args | Yes | Independent argument array; placeholders are expanded. |
| cwd | Yes | Exactly {root} or one alias. |
| log | Yes | Unique single .log name under reports. |
| timeout_secs | Yes | 1..=3600; may be overridden by timeout_env. |
| timeout_env | No | Environment variable for timeout override. |
| parser | No | Parser ID from [parsers.*]. |
| services | No | Service IDs prepared before the command. |
| remove_env | No | Inherited variables removed before spawn. |
| depends_on | No | Step IDs that must complete first. |
| input | No | snapshot (default) or explicit repository. |
| kind | No | builtin-gate or omitted for an external step. |
| gate_type | No | secret-scan or architecture-audit for built-in gates. |
| runner | No | Versioned runner contract. |

Commands are spawned as program + args[]; shell strings such as sh -c and
bash -lc are rejected. Split pipelines into separate steps or use a versioned
project executable. Built-in secret-scan and architecture-audit gates run before
external steps. Reserved built-in IDs cannot be replaced by an external step.

## 13. Secret scan rules

paths.secrets_config points to a separate, version-controlled TOML file:

    version = 2

    [placeholders]
    minimum_unique_characters = 4
    maximum_nonalphanumeric_characters = 2
    prefixes = ["\${", "{{", "<"]
    markers = ["change-me", "replace-me", "placeholder"]
    exact = ["password", "secret"]

    [[rules]]
    id = "named-signing-secret"
    kind = "value"
    pattern = '''(?i)signing_secret\s*=\s*([A-Za-z0-9_-]{12,})'''
    capture = 1
    minimum_length = 12

Rule kinds are direct, value, postgres-url, and webhook-url. Missing, empty,
or malformed rules fail before scanning. Reports contain filenames and
locations, never secret values. Regular files larger than 16 MiB, symlink
escapes, and non-regular inputs are handled by the scanner's closed policy.

## 14. Audit rules and v2 migration

paths.audit_config points to the architecture auditor's TOML file:

    version = 2

    [engine]
    ignore_filename = ".auditignore"
    json_report_filename = "review_context.json"
    markdown_report_filename = "review_context.md"
    markdown_max_bytes = 4096
    markdown_occurrences_per_rule = 3

    [paths]
    exclude = ["target", "node_modules", "dist", ".git"]

Each scanned extension needs a matching
[engine.comment_syntax.<extension>] definition. Rules use explicit
path-prefix or regex allowlists:

    [[hard_rules]]
    name = "SQL writes stay in repositories"
    severity = "blocker"
    paths = ["api"]
    extensions = ["rs", "sql"]
    patterns = ['(?i)INSERT\s+INTO']
    allowlist = [
      { kind = "path-prefix", path = "services/api/src/repositories" },
      { kind = "regex", pattern = '^services/api/generated/.*\.rs$' },
    ]
    exclude_patterns = []

Paths must resolve to existing in-project directories. Absolute paths, ..
traversal, symlink escapes, unreadable files, and files larger than 16 MiB fail
closed. The auditor is a deterministic whole-file regex scanner, not an AST
parser; use a language-specific linter for AST rules.

<a id="audit-v2-migration"></a>

### Audit v2 migration

Audit v2 is the breaking configuration format introduced with Harness-Gate
3.0.0. A legacy file is never silently assigned new semantics. Missing
version, missing [engine], unknown versions, unknown fields, or string
allowlists fail and point here.

Add version = 2, copy the complete [engine] and required comment syntax sections
from the empty preset, and convert each string allowlist explicitly:

    allowlist = [
      { kind = "path-prefix", path = "services/api/src/repositories" },
      { kind = "regex", pattern = '^services/api/generated/.*\.rs$' },
    ]

String allowlists cannot be migrated reliably because their intent is
ambiguous. After conversion run harness-gate config check and harness-gate
audit and confirm every path, regex, and report option.

## 15. Reports, templates, and notifications

    [report_templates]
    root = "templates/harness-gate"
    template = "templates/harness-gate/verification.tera"
    junit = "junit.xml"

Template root and template must be repository-contained regular paths with no
traversal or symlink escape, and the template must end in .html or .tera.
Template and report roots must be disjoint. HTML output is test_result.html;
JUnit is a report-relative .xml path. Tera supports include, extends, and block
plus timestamp, profile, scope, steps, summary, components, and passed.

Canonical evidence is written under
<reports>/invocations/<invocation_id>/, including invocation.json, scope.json,
step logs, and reports. Legacy test_result.json and test_result.md remain
mirrored at the report root. Their contracts are
[machine-result.schema.json](../schema/machine-result.schema.json),
[artifact-manifest.schema.json](../schema/artifact-manifest.schema.json), and
[artifact-registry.schema.json](../schema/artifact-registry.schema.json).
Artifacts are invocation-relative ordinary files with kind, byte count, and
SHA-256. Missing, extra, outside, replaced, or symlinked artifacts make
evidence_complete false.

Reports, logs, audit output, SBOMs, and webhook diagnostics redact cookies,
authorization headers, Bearer/Basic credentials, API keys, passwords, private
key blocks, and common database URL values. The latest 50 invocations are
retained; cleanup never removes an active or recently modified invocation.

Webhooks run after report writing:

    [[notifications.webhooks]]
    url = "https://hooks.example.test/events"
    allowed_hosts = ["hooks.example.test"]
    on_failure = true
    on_success = false

URLs must use http or https, have no userinfo or wildcard host, and list an
exact host in allowed_hosts. Each connection re-resolves the host and rejects
loopback, private, link-local, unspecified, and multicast addresses. Redirects
and proxy environment variables are disabled. Non-2xx responses, connection
errors, and policy denials fail verification with E1404 without changing the
written report. At least one result type must be enabled; webhooks run in
declaration order and stop after the first failure.

## 16. Signed out-of-process adapters

Adapters are not a step kind in flow.toml. The explicit harness-gate adapter
run command accepts a signed JSON request, a trusted Ed25519 key, and capability
allowlists. The contract is
[adapter-request.schema.json](../schema/adapter-request.schema.json), and the
protocol is described by
[ADR-0033](adr/0033-signed-out-of-process-adapter-protocol.md).

The host verifies protocol and result versions, executable SHA-256, complete
request signature, nonce/expiry replay protection, and artifact confinement
before spawning. It clears inherited environment and injects only declared
values. This is a protocol-level boundary, not an operating-system sandbox.
Bounded stdout/stderr and artifact limits map timeout, cancellation, crash,
non-zero exit, malformed output, signature, and confinement errors to the stable
ADAPTER_PROTOCOL_FAILURE code.

## 17. v1 to v2 checklist

Use migration to create a v2 file without deleting the source:

    harness-gate --project-root /path/to/project config migrate \
      --input legacy.flow.toml \
      --output .harness-gate/flow.toml
    harness-gate --project-root /path/to/project config check

Keep version = 2 explicit. When preflight rejects a file, follow the
diagnostic's primary field, related fields, and help text. Add explicit
dependencies, use distinct service injection names, and assign one log file per
step. Harness-Gate never silently reorders steps, inserts dependencies, or
rewrites configuration.

For generated schema files, validation commands, and release compatibility
guarantees, see the [schema catalog](../schema/README.md) and the repository
[README](../README.md).
