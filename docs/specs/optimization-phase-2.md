# Optimization Phase 2: Performance and Code Quality Enhancement

## Meta

- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: 2026-08-26
- **Author**: Claude Opus 5
- **Related ADR**: 0005-phase-2-optimization-strategy.md
- **Depends On**: optimization-phase-1.md
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days
- **Priority**: High

## Context

Phase 1 successfully resolved all CI failures and established a clean baseline:
- ✅ All tests passing on all platforms
- ✅ Zero Clippy warnings
- ✅ Code coverage reporting working
- ✅ CI pipeline stable

Phase 2 focuses on **performance optimization** and **deeper code quality improvements** that require more substantial refactoring.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve test performance** - Reduce test execution time by 30-50%
2. **Optimize binary size** - Reduce release binary size by 20-30%
3. **Reduce compilation time** - Speed up development iteration
4. **Enhance error handling** - Better error messages and context
5. **Improve code maintainability** - Reduce complexity in hot paths

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Test suite runs in < 10 seconds (currently ~20-30s)
- [ ] Release binary < 5MB (currently ~6-8MB)
- [ ] Compilation time < 30s for incremental builds
- [ ] All functions with cyclomatic complexity < 10
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Test Performance Optimization

#### Problem
- Test suite takes 20-30 seconds to run
- Many tests create temporary directories and Git repositories
- File I/O operations are synchronous and blocking

#### Solution
```rust
// Current: Each test creates its own temp dir
#[test]
fn test_something() {
    let test_dir = TestDir::new("test-name");
    // ... operations ...
}

// Proposed: Shared test fixture with cleanup
pub struct TestFixture {
    base_dir: PathBuf,
    git_initialized: bool,
}

impl TestFixture {
    fn with_git() -> Self { /* ... */ }
    fn workspace(&self, name: &str) -> TestWorkspace { /* ... */ }
}

#[test]
fn test_something() {
    let fixture = TestFixture::with_git();
    let workspace = fixture.workspace("test-1");
    // Reuse Git repo, faster setup
}
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create `TestFixture` abstraction in `tests/common/mod.rs`
2. Implement workspace isolation within shared Git repo
3. Add parallel test execution support
4. Cache compiled test binaries

#### Expected Impact
- Test execution time: 20-30s → 8-12s
- Reduced disk I/O: ~80% fewer temp directories
- Better CI cache utilization

---

### 2. Binary Size Optimization

#### Problem
- Release binary is 6-8MB
- Contains debug symbols and unused code
- Not optimized for size

#### Solution
```toml
# Cargo.toml additions
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"          # Optimize for size
lto = true               # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1        # Better optimization
strip = true             # Strip symbols
panic = "abort"          # Smaller panic handler

[profile.release-small]
inherits = "release"
opt-level = "z"
lto = "fat"
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add size-optimized release profile
2. Audit dependencies for bloat (use `cargo-bloat`)
3. Remove unused features from dependencies
4. Consider replacing heavy dependencies:
   - `tokio` → `smol` (if async is minimal)
   - `serde_json` → `tinyjson` (if JSON is simple)
5. Profile with `cargo-bloat` and `twiggy`

#### Expected Impact
- Binary size: 6-8MB → 4-5MB
- Faster downloads and installations
- Reduced memory footprint

---

### 3. Compilation Time Reduction

#### Problem
- Clean build takes 2-3 minutes
- Incremental builds take 30-45 seconds
- Large dependency tree

#### Solution
```toml
# Cargo.toml additions
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 1            # Faster builds, reasonable perf
incremental = true       # Enable incremental compilation

[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 2            # Optimize dependencies once

# Split large modules
[workspace]
members = [
    "tools/harness-gate",
    "tools/harness-gate-core",  # New: core logic
    "tools/harness-gate-cli",   # New: CLI interface
]
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Enable dev profile optimization
2. Split `main.rs` into smaller modules
3. Consider workspace split if modules are too large
4. Use `cargo-chef` in Docker builds
5. Optimize CI caching strategy

#### Expected Impact
- Clean build: 2-3min → 1.5-2min
- Incremental build: 30-45s → 15-25s
- Better developer experience

---

### 4. Error Handling Enhancement

#### Problem
- Generic error messages like "Operation failed"
- Missing context in error chains
- Hard to debug failures

#### Solution
```rust
// Current
pub fn run_audit(path: &Path) -> Result<AuditResult> {
    let config = load_config(path)?;  // Generic error
    // ...
}

// Proposed
use anyhow::Context;

pub fn run_audit(path: &Path) -> Result<AuditResult> {
    let config = load_config(path)
        .context(format!("Failed to load audit config from {}", path.display()))?;
    
    let rules = parse_rules(&config)
        .context("Failed to parse audit rules")?;
    
    // ...
}

// Even better: Custom error types
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum AuditError {
    #[error("Audit config not found at {path}")]
    ConfigNotFound { path: PathBuf },
    
    #[error("Invalid rule '{rule_name}': {reason}")]
    InvalidRule { rule_name: String, reason: String },
    
    #[error("Scan failed for {path}: {source}")]
    ScanFailed { path: PathBuf, source: std::io::Error },
}
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Audit all `?` operators and add `.context()`
2. Create domain-specific error types with `thiserror`
3. Add error recovery hints in error messages
4. Include relevant file paths and line numbers
5. Add structured error output (JSON) option

#### Expected Impact
- Clearer error messages for users
- Easier debugging
- Better user experience

---

### 5. Code Complexity Reduction

#### Problem
- Some functions have high cyclomatic complexity
- Large functions mixing multiple concerns
- Hard to test and maintain

#### Solution
```rust
// Current: Large function doing multiple things
pub fn verify_workflow(config: &Config, profile: &str) -> Result<()> {
    // 100+ lines of logic
    // Multiple responsibilities
    // Hard to test
}

// Proposed: Split into smaller, focused functions
pub fn verify_workflow(config: &Config, profile: &str) -> Result<()> {
    let scope = determine_scope(config)?;
    let steps = select_steps(config, profile, &scope)?;
    let results = execute_steps(&steps)?;
    generate_report(&results)?;
    Ok(())
}

fn determine_scope(config: &Config) -> Result<Scope> { /* ... */ }
fn select_steps(config: &Config, profile: &str, scope: &Scope) -> Result<Vec<Step>> { /* ... */ }
fn execute_steps(steps: &[Step]) -> Result<StepResults> { /* ... */ }
fn generate_report(results: &StepResults) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Run `cargo-clippy` with complexity lints enabled
2. Identify functions with complexity > 10
3. Extract helper functions
4. Use builder patterns for complex configurations
5. Add unit tests for extracted functions

#### Expected Impact
- Better code maintainability
- Easier to add new features
- Improved test coverage

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Performance Foundation
- [ ] Day 1-2: Test infrastructure refactoring
- [ ] Day 3: Binary size optimization
- [ ] Day 4: Compilation time improvements
- [ ] Day 5: Benchmark and measure

### Week 2: Quality Enhancement
- [ ] Day 1-2: Error handling enhancement
- [ ] Day 3-4: Code complexity reduction
- [ ] Day 5: Documentation and review

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Test refactoring breaking existing tests** 
  - Mitigation: Incremental migration, keep old tests until new ones pass

### Medium Risk
- **Binary size optimization affecting performance**
  - Mitigation: Benchmark before/after, keep separate profiles
  
- **Breaking changes in error types**
  - Mitigation: This is internal, no public API changes

### Low Risk
- **Compilation time improvements**
  - Mitigation: Easy to revert profile changes

## Dependencies

### Required Tools
- `cargo-bloat` - Binary size analysis
- `cargo-expand` - Macro expansion debugging
- `cargo-llvm-lines` - LLVM line count analysis
- `twiggy` - Code size profiler
- `criterion` - Benchmarking (if needed)

### Blocked By
- Phase 1 completion ✅ (Done)
- PR #4 merge ⏳ (Pending)

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Merge Phase 1 PR** (#4)
2. **Create Phase 2 branch** (`optimize/phase-2`)
3. **Implement in order**:
   - Test performance (least risky)
   - Compilation time (easy wins)
   - Binary size (measure first)
   - Error handling (internal improvement)
   - Code complexity (largest refactor)
4. **Create PR with benchmarks**
5. **Review and merge**

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- ✅ All tests still passing
- ✅ No new Clippy warnings
- ✅ Test execution time < 15s
- ✅ Binary size < 6MB

### Should Have
- ✅ Error messages include context
- ✅ Compilation time < 30s (incremental)
- ✅ Code coverage maintained or improved

### Nice to Have
- ✅ Binary size < 5MB
- ✅ Test execution time < 10s
- ✅ All functions complexity < 10

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Skip Phase 2, Move to Features
**Pros**: Deliver user value faster
**Cons**: Technical debt accumulates, harder to maintain
**Decision**: Rejected - Phase 2 provides foundation for future features

### Alternative 2: Do Full Rewrite
**Pros**: Perfect architecture
**Cons**: Months of work, high risk
**Decision**: Rejected - Incremental improvement is safer

### Alternative 3: Focus Only on Performance
**Pros**: Clear metrics, user-visible improvements
**Cons**: Ignores code quality debt
**Decision**: Partial - Include both performance and quality

## Questions & Decisions

### Q1: Should we split into workspace?
**A**: Only if compilation time doesn't improve with simpler changes. Workspace adds complexity.

### Q2: Which dependencies should we optimize first?
**A**: Run `cargo-bloat` to identify. Likely candidates: `regex`, `serde`, `clap`.

### Q3: How aggressive should binary size optimization be?
**A**: Balance size vs performance. Keep separate `release` and `release-small` profiles.

## Appendix: Benchmark Plan

```bash
# Before Phase 2
time cargo test
time cargo build --release
ls -lh target/release/harness-gate

# After Phase 2
time cargo test  # Expect: < 15s
time cargo build --release  # Expect: similar or faster
ls -lh target/release/harness-gate  # Expect: < 6MB

# Detailed profiling
cargo bloat --release
cargo llvm-lines | head -20
```
