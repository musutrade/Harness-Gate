# ADR-0033: Signed Out-of-Process Adapter Protocol

## Status

**Implemented** (2026-08-31); request-integrity hardening accepted in
[ADR-0037](0037-adapter-request-integrity-and-evidence-budgets.md) (2026-09-01)

## Decision

Future organization-specific runners and scanners use a signed, out-of-process
adapter protocol. Harness-Gate does not load dynamic libraries into the main
process and does not expose an unstable in-process plugin API.

An adapter receives one JSON request on stdin and returns one JSON response on
stdout. Protocol v2 signs a canonical representation of the complete request:
adapter identity, invocation and step IDs, timeout, configuration digest,
artifact root, arguments, input, environment, capabilities, nonce, and
validity window. The response uses machine-result schema version 1 and may
reference only artifacts below the invocation root. Logs are streamed on
stderr and captured through the same redaction and manifest pipeline as
built-in steps.

Before dispatch, Harness-Gate verifies the adapter binary digest and complete
request signature, checks the supported protocol/result-schema matrix, checks
the nonce validity window and replay guard, and rejects undeclared
capabilities or invalid environment keys. A timeout, output-budget breach, or
crash fails only the adapter node; dependency propagation, cancellation,
leases, and report publication remain scheduler responsibilities. Upgrades
require a new signed digest and can be rolled back by selecting the previous
adapter record without deleting evidence.

## Compatibility Contract

Protocol and result schema versions are independent. Additive fields are
backward-compatible within a major protocol version; breaking changes require
a new major version and an explicit migration. Protocol v1 declaration-only
requests are rejected; v2 is the supported request version. The adapter must
declare the minimum and maximum Harness-Gate versions it supports. Contract
fixtures cover PASS, FAIL, CANCELLED, timeout, malformed response, artifact
escape, crash, tampered request fields, expired requests, nonce replay, and
output-budget breaches.

## Security Boundary

Adapters run with a per-invocation working directory, no inherited secret
environment, and only declared protocol-level network/resource permissions.
The host records the source digest, signature identity, request nonce and
validity window, capability declaration, exit status, output/reader limits,
and cleanup outcome. An invalid signature, replayed/expired request,
unsupported capability, malformed response, output-budget breach, or artifact
escape is a blocking `ADAPTER_PROTOCOL_FAILURE`. These checks are not an
operating-system network, filesystem, resource, or process sandbox; process
group termination is a bounded cleanup attempt only.

## Rollout

This ADR is a P2 evolution track. Built-in runner cutover does not depend on
adapter support. The host implementation is in
`tools/harness-gate/src/process/adapter.rs`, with the
`harness-gate adapter run` entry point and deterministic fixture in
`tools/quality/fixtures/adapter/`. The protocol fixtures cover complete-request
signature and digest validation, capability rejection, malformed responses,
crash, timeout, cancellation, artifact escape, replay/expiry, invalid
environment keys, and output limits on every supported platform in CI. Adapter
execution remains opt-in and is not enabled by built-in steps.
