# Harness-Gate Engineering Policy

Status: **Normative repository policy**

This document defines engineering invariants that apply to every change in this repository, whether the work is performed by a human, Codex, Symphony, another agent, or automation. Accepted ADRs and OpenSpec changes explain and evolve individual decisions; this policy states the durable rules that all later work inherits.

An OpenSpec or issue does not need to repeat these rules. Silence does not disable them. A change may alter a rule only through an explicit normative policy delta with rationale, compatibility/measurement evidence, rollback consequences, and review. Change-specific acceptance criteria may be stricter than this policy but may not silently weaken it.

## 1. Authority and measurement boundary

- Collectors measure and normalize facts. They do not decide final delivery PASS/FAIL.
- Requiredness, thresholds, baseline/lineage rules, debt and ratchet semantics, cross-component aggregation, and final generic decisions belong to the released Rust Harness-Gate core.
- External collectors/adapters may use any implementation language. Their language does not transfer decision authority out of the Rust core.
- A reference, shadow, compatibility, migration, or advisory implementation cannot approve a release or silently become an authoritative fallback.

## 2. Fail-closed required gates

- A required gate may pass only from valid evidence and a successful authoritative decision.
- Missing, stale, malformed, mixed-identity, incompatible, modified, or unverifiable evidence must not become success.
- `unsupported`, `not_configured`, `not_collected`, `not_applicable`, and `measurement_error` are distinct capability states. None may be fabricated as a favorable numeric value.
- If policy requires a capability that is expected to be supported, missing collection or measurement failure is a blocking failure. A genuinely uncertified ecosystem capability must remain explicitly unsupported rather than being guessed.
- Tool failure, timeout, runner loss, missing artifact, parser failure, or collector crash must never be converted to PASS merely to keep delivery moving.

## 3. CRAP, coverage, complexity, and risk

CRAP is a normal quality gate for an ecosystem and measurement series only after that capability has been explicitly validated. For the currently accepted Rust risk series:

- changed production functions require exact CRAP `<= 30`;
- selected functions and changed functions with cyclomatic complexity greater than 10 additionally require line coverage `>= 80%` and region coverage `>= 80%`;
- historical unmodified debt may remain visible under the accepted debt policy, but new debt is forbidden and existing debt must not regress;
- improvements must not silently rebound through a baseline or lineage reset;
- changes outside a certified measurement boundary must fail for measurement review rather than receive invented CRAP or coverage results.

For ecosystems whose CRAP capability has not been certified, CRAP must remain `unsupported`; similar-looking complexity or coverage numbers must not be combined into an invented cross-tool CRAP series.

Thresholds, measurement-series identity, and supported source boundaries are policy. They must not be weakened, widened, or replaced merely to make CI green. Any intentional change requires an explicit policy delta and compatible evidence.

## 4. Debt and no-regression ratchet

- Historical debt may be retained only when the governing policy explicitly permits it and the debt remains visible.
- New or newly selected code must not create new quality debt.
- Existing debt must not worsen.
- An improvement cannot be discarded by silently rebasing to the worse state.
- Exceptions document reviewed context and compensating controls; they do not turn a failing quality measurement into a passing one unless a separately approved policy explicitly defines that behavior.

## 5. CI repair integrity

A failing required gate must be repaired at its root cause. The following are not acceptable CI fixes unless they are the subject of an explicit reviewed policy change:

- lowering CRAP, coverage, complexity, critical-path, performance, or other quality thresholds;
- changing a required gate to advisory or optional;
- deleting or skipping a failing test, mandatory matrix row, supported source, or required platform solely to obtain green status;
- swallowing errors, treating missing evidence as success, or adding an automatic fallback to a non-authoritative implementation;
- broadening waivers/exceptions or resetting baselines to hide a regression;
- changing measurement series so incompatible values can be compared as if they were continuous.

Rollback must preserve evidence and trust semantics. A reviewed revert may remove a broken extension, but it must not rewrite history or silently accept a weaker baseline.

## 6. Verification profiles and cost

Quality is continuous, but not every measurement belongs in every latency tier.

- `hook` is the fast deterministic developer path. Expensive full coverage/CRAP collection and broad cross-platform certification need not run here.
- `full` is the normal complete local verification path and must run the required quality measurements supported by the selected project/policy, including CRAP where certified and required.
- `ci` is the authoritative hosted verification path. It must preserve required evidence, baseline/ratchet semantics, and fail-closed aggregation.
- Expensive cross-platform or ecosystem-certification work should be risk-driven by affected capabilities/paths when that can be done without weakening required assurance.
- CI performance regressions are engineering regressions. New required work must state its expected profile/critical-path cost and avoid unnecessary recollection of equivalent evidence.

## 7. Project-owned validation and extension boundaries

Application- and repository-specific validation logic belongs to the project being verified. Harness-Gate orchestrates, ingests and decides at generic boundaries; it does not become the implementation home for every API, E2E, integration, smoke, migration, load, generation or framework-specific test system.

Harness-Gate extensions are divided into three layers:

- **Command hooks / execution gates** run project-owned validation commands. Harness-Gate owns generic orchestration semantics such as scope/profile selection, dependencies, services, environment handling, timeout, retry, requiredness, logs/artifacts and blocking composition. The project owns the test code, fixtures, domain assertions and tool invocation semantics.
- **Structured result adapters** may ingest reusable machine formats such as JUnit, SARIF or versioned JSON contracts to improve diagnostics and reporting. Parsing a tool result does not transfer requiredness, threshold, ratchet or release authority to that tool or parser.
- **Quality collector plugins** measure normalized facts intended for generic policy evaluation. Collectors remain measurement-only; the released Rust core retains requiredness, thresholds, baseline/ratchet/debt, cross-component aggregation and final generic quality decisions.

A new application validation tool or framework must not require a Harness-Gate Generic Core code change merely to participate if its validation can be expressed through the generic command-hook contract. Native product support is justified only for a reusable protocol, structured-result format, service/execution primitive, ecosystem/capability pack, certification boundary or generic policy semantic—not merely because a particular test runner or framework is popular.

When migrating an existing project with mature validation, current required assurance is the migration baseline until replacement parity and fail-closed behavior are evidenced. A migration must not obtain success by silently dropping, weakening or reclassifying valid project-owned gates. Unsupported migration semantics are product/capability gaps to surface and resolve, not reasons to weaken the project.

## 8. OpenSpec and change governance

Every OpenSpec, issue, PR, and agent task inherits this document.

Changes touching quality, coverage, complexity, CRAP, collectors, evidence, policy, baseline, ratchet/debt, exceptions, CI profiles, presets, project aggregation, release authority, project-validation ownership, structured-result ingestion, or extension boundaries must explicitly state one of:

- the relevant engineering-policy semantics are unchanged; or
- the change proposes a normative policy delta and identifies the exact rule being changed.

A policy delta requires rationale, migration/compatibility impact, negative/fail-closed tests, and evidence demonstrating that the change is intentional rather than a workaround for a failing gate.

## 9. Documentation and machine enforcement

This policy is the normative human/agent contract. ADRs provide decision history; OpenSpec provides change-specific deltas; Harness-Gate configuration and Rust policy code provide executable enforcement.

Documentation and machine enforcement must not knowingly drift. Where a normative rule can be checked deterministically, repository consistency/contract tests should guard it. A documentation mismatch must not be resolved by weakening the machine gate without an approved policy delta.

## 10. Stable compiler interfaces and first-party Rust plugin delivery

### Native delivery amendment (2026-09-14)

The user has explicitly selected the existing native measurement engine for
independent delivery, with the matching toolchain supplied externally. This
amendment takes precedence over the stable-only and pure-Rust-runtime restrictions
below for the **native collector product**. It does not make the stable candidate
a prerequisite for native delivery.

- Preserve the native MIR instrumentation, owner mapping, coverage, complexity and
  CRAP definitions and all existing fail-closed and historical debt rules. No
  temporary macro exemption or stable measurement substitution is introduced.
- Publish our precompiled program and necessary adapter resources using Core's
  release eligibility, checksum, Sigstore, provenance and immutable-release flow.
  Do not bundle Rust, LLVM, Python, a linker or their system environments.
- The native product may use its existing compiler-private driver and Python
  adapters. Its exact supported rustc commit, compiler libraries, LLVM tools,
  Python and linker requirements are explicit external dependencies. Check them
  before collection; call the selected compiler directly without changing the
  user's default toolchain or automatically installing dependencies.
- The stable implementation remains an explicitly selected candidate. Do not
  automatically switch engines, reinterpret metrics, adopt historical baselines
  or reset lineage. Packaging/tool-path changes must retain their actual identity;
  any continuity claim requires comparison evidence and explicit migration.
- The new native release must pass real native collection, re-export, Core policy
  and installation tests. Existing immutable releases remain untouched. The old
  bundled-runtime publication workflow remains suspended; it is not re-enabled.
- Core's ordinary required CI continues to use stable public interfaces. The
  native product's explicitly selected build/acceptance workflow may use its
  pinned compiler-private implementation.

The remaining stable-only requirements describe the stable candidate and its
future promotion, not a prohibition on the authorized native delivery above.

- Officially released plugins and required CI gates MUST NOT depend on unstable compiler APIs, `rustc_private`, `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`, nightly-only features or `-Z` flags. Using a stable compiler executable with an instability escape hatch does not satisfy this rule.
- The first-party Rust quality collector MUST be implemented entirely in Rust, including its command entry, orchestration, measurement, normalization, validation and user-facing lifecycle logic. Its installed runtime MUST NOT require Python or ship a private Python interpreter. This is specific to our Rust collector; it does not prohibit third-party adapters in other languages or repository-only test/release automation.
- Publish our own precompiled plugin artifacts and necessary resources by supported target, following Harness-Gate's release verification model. Users install the documented external Rust/Cargo/coverage and project-native dependencies. Do not bundle entire Rust/LLVM/C/Python environments by default or silently install/change users' toolchains and system packages. User approval of an optional dependency-install action must be explicit.
- Compatibility MUST follow documented and tested public interfaces and actual runtime requirements, not publisher kernel or distribution equality. Rust coverage data and LLVM tools still need compatible versions. Record the selected toolchain and evidence format; do not claim unrestricted cross-version compatibility or discard provenance because the interfaces are public.
- Stable coverage flags, compatible coverage tools and source syntax analysis are the preferred production path. Unsupported macros, conditional compilation, generated code or ambiguous source/coverage ownership MUST remain explicit capability errors or unsupported boundaries; they must not be guessed or counted as success.
- Source availability alone MUST NOT be treated as proof of measurement accuracy. Distinguish the macro implementation from the code generated for a particular invocation. Accurate generated-source metrics require the selected dependency source/version, invocation inputs, relevant features/cfg/target/build inputs, verified generated code or validated measurement rules, and unambiguous ownership under a declared metric definition. Coverage additionally requires actual execution evidence; macro source cannot establish which generated paths ran. Source-level metrics must not be presented as exact compiler-internal metrics.
- A macro or derive invocation alone MUST NOT justify blanket unsupported classification. Investigate concrete gaps using a minimal reproducer, fixed inputs and regression fixtures. Correct defects in our collector through a focused PR; for dependency defects, prepare a focused source-level patch and regression test and prefer an upstream PR. Track upstream acceptance and the fixed release independently; temporary downstream patches require explicit source/version provenance and an exit plan. An upstream submission or available source is not proof that the installed dependency is fixed.
- When stable interfaces lack necessary information, document the specific missing information and tested boundary and track the upstream capability request or validated alternative. Do not claim an arbitrary library patch can expose absent compiler information. Fixes must preserve the measured program's business behavior and the metric contract; changing either requires an explicit reviewed change. Promote support only after real measurement validation, including generated-code ownership and failure cases, without weakening required gates.
- Replacing MIR-based measurements with source/standard-coverage measurements is a new measurement series. Validate definitions and boundaries with real positive/negative fixtures and side-by-side evidence before promotion. Existing thresholds, requiredness and historical evidence remain authoritative until a reviewed transition; never mix incomparable old/new values or automatically adopt/reset a baseline.
- Compiler-internal experiments may remain explicitly opt-in, isolated and non-authoritative. Required CI may test that prohibited behavior is rejected, but MUST NOT need to enable or build the unstable backend. Experiments must not enter official installation, signing/publication or required measurement through a fallback.
- During this migration, existing immutable releases and historical verification remain available as legacy evidence. New signing/publication of the legacy Python/compiler-private Rust collector and its installer is suspended. Reopening publication requires the pure-Rust stable implementation, its release contract, actual installation/upgrade and measurement acceptance, and an explicit reviewed change removing the migration hold. The independent Harness-Gate Core release and existing stable required gates continue normally.

## 11. Source decisions

This policy consolidates durable rules already established by accepted repository decisions, especially:

- ADR-0039, required coverage/risk/traceability gates;
- ADR-0040, language-agnostic evidence/policy and fail-closed authority boundary;
- ADR-0049, project-owned validation and generic extension boundaries;
- ADR-0053, stable interfaces and pure-Rust collector delivery;
- the accepted Rust generic-core authority transfer and Python retention policy.

Those records remain the detailed source for measurement identities, historical acceptance evidence, migration chronology, and extension-boundary rationale.
