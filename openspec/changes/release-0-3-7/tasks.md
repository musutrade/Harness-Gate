# Tasks: Release Harness-Gate 0.3.7

**Parent:** [proposal.md](proposal.md)
**Status:** Proposed; operational evidence will be recorded in
[proposal.md](proposal.md) after publication.

- [ ] Synchronize package version, lockfile, CLI version assertion, snapshots,
  changelog, project status, README examples, and release governance.
- [ ] Run package validation, formatting, linting, tests, OpenSpec validation,
  and documentation consistency checks locally.
- [ ] Create the release pull request and pass every required PR check.
- [ ] Merge the release pull request, wait for the protected `main` CI run,
  and create the immutable `v0.3.7` tag at that exact commit.
- [ ] Approve the protected publication environment after policy and quality
  gates pass; verify the release workflow publishes the exact asset inventory
  to GitHub Release and the crate to crates.io.
- [ ] Download and verify the published inventory, checksums, Sigstore
  signatures/certificates, provenance, crate, and clean-environment installer
  flow.
- [ ] Record the tag, workflow, release URL, asset verification, and clean
  environment results in the release proposal and release governance, then
  mark this release record Implemented.
