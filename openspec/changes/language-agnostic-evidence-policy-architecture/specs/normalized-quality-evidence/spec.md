# Capability: Normalized Quality Evidence

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Introduce a versioned generic evidence envelope
Harness-Gate SHALL define a versioned normalized evidence envelope, initially `harness-evidence/v1`, that records project/component identity, collector identity, measurement series, subject identity, metrics, capabilities, commit/target/run provenance, raw artifact references, source integrity, and measurement status.

#### Scenario: Normalize equivalent metrics from different ecosystems
- **GIVEN** a Rust collector and a TypeScript collector that both report cyclomatic complexity
- **WHEN** their outputs are normalized
- **THEN** both use the same generic evidence envelope
- **AND** their collector, series, language, source, and raw artifact provenance remain distinct.

### Requirement: Preserve raw evidence and existing Rust contracts
The generic envelope SHALL coexist with existing tool-specific and Rust-specific evidence contracts. Existing accepted evidence SHALL NOT be silently rewritten or broadened in place merely to fit the generic model.

#### Scenario: Project current Rust complexity evidence
- **GIVEN** a valid record conforming to the existing Rust `quality-evidence.schema.json`
- **WHEN** it is projected into `harness-evidence/v1`
- **THEN** the original record remains retained and addressable
- **AND** the normalized record preserves its series identity, source digest, symbol identity, raw counts, and metric value.

### Requirement: Distinguish capability and measurement states
Normalized evidence SHALL distinguish at least `supported`, `unsupported`, `not_configured`, `not_collected`, `measurement_error`, and `not_applicable` capability/measurement states. Non-numeric states MUST NOT be coerced into numeric pass values.

#### Scenario: Unsupported branch coverage
- **GIVEN** a collector whose measurement contract does not support branch coverage
- **WHEN** normalized evidence is produced
- **THEN** branch coverage is marked `unsupported` with provenance
- **AND** no `0%` or `100%` branch coverage value is fabricated.

### Requirement: Validate provenance and integrity fail closed
Harness-Gate SHALL reject normalized evidence whose required commit/base/run identity, source digest, subject identity, raw artifact reference, or series metadata is missing, stale, malformed, duplicated, or incompatible for the requested evaluation.

#### Scenario: Detect stale evidence
- **GIVEN** normalized evidence whose source digest does not match the evaluated source
- **WHEN** the evidence is validated
- **THEN** validation returns `measurement_error`
- **AND** the evidence cannot satisfy a required gate.

### Requirement: Keep incompatible measurement series incomparable
Measurements from incompatible series SHALL NOT be compared numerically for regression or baseline acceptance unless a separately defined migration explicitly establishes compatibility.

#### Scenario: Analyzer rule version changes
- **GIVEN** base evidence produced by complexity rule version 1 and head evidence produced by rule version 2
- **WHEN** a ratchet attempts to compare them
- **THEN** the comparison is rejected as incompatible
- **AND** the system does not claim improvement or regression from the numeric values alone.

### Requirement: Use explicit typed values and deterministic serialization
The v1 envelope SHALL use discriminated ratio, count, boolean, duration, size and
exact decimal forms. Ratios SHALL retain covered/total integers with a positive
denominator. Metric names SHALL match their declared series value types. Canonical
serialization SHALL validate the complete batch and provenance before emitting
UTF-8 JSON with sorted object keys, compact separators and preserved array order.

#### Scenario: Reject ambiguous or fabricated values
- **GIVEN** a metric with an untyped JSON number, unknown type, or zero denominator
- **WHEN** the normalized record is validated
- **THEN** validation returns `measurement_error`.
- **AND** every non-supported capability is forbidden from carrying any metric value.

### Requirement: Enforce explicit capability availability policy
Capability requirements SHALL specify component, metric, required/informational
mode and a blocked/measurement_error outcome for unavailable required metrics.
Availability results SHALL preserve the original capability state and evidence ID
and SHALL NOT constitute a numeric threshold or release decision.

#### Scenario: Preserve informational unsupported state
- **GIVEN** valid unsupported evidence with raw provenance
- **WHEN** an informational capability requirement is evaluated
- **THEN** the result remains `unsupported` without a numeric value.
- **AND** a required requirement produces its explicit blocking outcome.

#### Scenario: Reject a false support claim
- **GIVEN** a supported capability with missing metric evidence
- **WHEN** either required or informational availability is evaluated
- **THEN** validation returns `measurement_error` before availability evaluation.
