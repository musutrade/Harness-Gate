# Tasks

- [x] T1: Record the user-approved normative policy and guard legacy publication.
- [x] T2: Inventory legacy collector/runtime/installer behavior and stable CI; define the pure-Rust replacement contract and supported measurement boundaries.
- [ ] T3: Implement pure-Rust entry, dependency checks, stable coverage collection and source complexity analysis without compiler-private APIs or Python runtime dependencies.
- [ ] T4: Implement protocol-compatible validation/normalization, preserved Core authority and explicit capability/identity failures.
- [ ] T5: Implement lightweight verified publication/installation/upgrade/rollback with user-installed dependencies and measured artifact sizes.
- [ ] T6: Run real multi-toolchain, cross-host, negative, source-boundary and old/new measurement comparisons; review the new series transition without baseline reset.
- [ ] T7: Update CI with stable-only acceptance, publish support/limitations documentation and complete all required checks.
- [ ] T8: Remove the legacy publication hold only with reviewed replacement acceptance; production publication remains separately protected.

Documentation or a prototype alone does not complete T2–T8. The policy PR closes
only T1; the implementation issue remains open until the runnable replacement,
release preparation and actual acceptance are complete.

## GH-259 candidate checkpoint

T2 inventory and implementation design: `docs/quality/stable-rust-collector.md`.
Actual candidate execution and remaining acceptance:
`docs/quality/stable-rust-collector-validation.md`. T3 has a runnable Rust capture
and AST implementation, but the second toolchain remains unverified. T4 has
integrity checks only; Core authentication/normalization is pending. T5 lifecycle,
T6 certified migration/matrix, complete T7 acceptance and T8 remain unchecked.
The successful candidate deliberately cannot satisfy required Core measurements.
