# Proposal: Configuration Safety Diagnostics and Future-Concurrency Preflight

**Status:** In Review
**Date:** 2026-08-28
**Change type:** Configuration-contract, diagnostics, documentation, and test-plan specification

## Scope Notice

This OpenSpec change defines and implements the remaining Phase 2
configuration-system safety boundary. It adds typed validation infrastructure,
the opt-in JSON diagnostic output, safe report-template path declarations, and
their tests and documentation. It does not start services, schedule work in
parallel, or render reports; those remain separate future changes.

## Why

ADR-0023 already provides JSON Schema export and `${NAME}` /
`${NAME:-default}` interpolation. ADR-0024 already validates `depends_on` and
creates a stable serial dependency order. The current validator rejects many
invalid values, but its errors are generally prose-only and fail fast. A user
cannot reliably identify the exact field, the other end of a conflict, a
source location, or a concrete safe repair.

The current serial execution model also hides invalid relationships that would
become races when a later scheduler runs independent steps together. In
particular, services may inject the same child-process environment variable,
independent steps may acquire the same service, and steps may overwrite a
shared log. A future HTML/Tera report feature would likewise need a path policy
before it accepts template names.

Without a contract now, a scheduler or renderer would have to invent error,
resource, and filesystem behavior after external work has begun. That would
make compatibility, security review, and editor integration substantially
harder.

## What Changes

- Defines a stable, field-addressable configuration diagnostic model for TOML
  parsing, environment interpolation, semantic validation, and multi-field
  resource conflicts.
- Defines deterministic human and JSON diagnostic-rendering contracts for
  `config check`, including compatibility with the existing failure category
  and no secret disclosure.
- Defines a conservative potential-concurrency graph and static preflight
  rules for service injection names, service resources, and log files.
- Adds an optional `[report_templates]` declaration whose paths are validated
  as read-only, repository-contained template inputs; it does not add a
  renderer or template engine.
- Defines editor instructions, migration guidance, examples, negative fixtures,
  and documentation/schema validation evidence required for completion.

## Goals

1. Make every configuration error independently actionable through a stable
   diagnostic ID, canonical field path, safe reason, and deterministic repair
   guidance.
2. Let editors and CI consume diagnostics without parsing human prose while
   preserving the existing default human `config check` experience and exit
   convention.
3. Reject service-injection, shared-service, and log-output hazards before any
   project discovery, subprocess, report write, or service operation begins.
4. Define a strict report-template root and symlink-containment policy before a
   template engine can access the filesystem.
5. Synchronize editor setup, migration guidance, examples, schema generation,
   and executable validation.

## Non-goals

- No parallel scheduler, `max_parallel` setting, cancellation-policy revision,
  service lock implementation, or container-runtime abstraction.
- No HTML report, Tera dependency, template renderer, or
  change to existing JSON/Markdown report locations or names.
- No automatic insertion of dependencies, renaming of log files, or mutation
  of service environment-variable names.
- No recursive interpolation, expression evaluation, change to interpolation
  precedence, or configuration-version bump.
- No change to the existing default CLI exit status, public error headline, or
  quality snapshot contract without explicit review.

## Success Metrics

| Area | Success criterion |
| --- | --- |
| Diagnostics | Every invalid fixture yields stable IDs, canonical paths, actionable help, deterministic order, and no interpolated secret values. |
| Source context | File-backed parse, interpolation, and semantic failures report accurate one-based source positions and related conflict locations where source positions are available. |
| Machine output | `config check --format json` produces a documented versioned JSON envelope for both valid and invalid configuration; CI and editor tests parse it without prose matching. |
| Concurrency preflight | All unordered injection/service conflicts and all duplicate logs are rejected; direct and transitive ordering suppresses only the concurrency-specific findings. |
| Template safety | The future renderer acceptance suite proves lexical, canonical, and symlink containment plus report/template-root separation on supported platforms. |
| Documentation | Schema/editor association, migration paths, valid examples, and negative fixtures pass the ADR-0025 documentation-consistency check. |
| Compatibility | Existing valid presets, serial plan order, interpolation precedence, report names, error category, and reviewed CLI snapshots remain compatible. |

## Impact and Risk

**Risk: Medium.** The intended final implementation changes configuration
validation behavior, so previously loadable but ambiguous v2 files may be
rejected. It must not change execution behavior for configurations that remain
valid.

| Dimension | Impact | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | Diagnostics or template handling could reveal secrets or allow filesystem escape. | Never render resolved values/template contents; require lexical and canonical containment plus symlink tests. |
| Compatibility | New validation can reject unsafe configurations that currently serialize and run serially. | Require explicit, deterministic diagnostics and migration guidance; preserve existing valid presets and default CLI conventions. |
| Performance | Graph analysis and source maps add load-time work. | Bound diagnostic collection to 50 entries and use linear/near-linear graph traversal; benchmark config loading only if measurements show a material regression. |
| Maintainability | Stable diagnostic IDs, JSON schema, and source-path grammar become a public contract. | Version the machine envelope, snapshot representative output, and centralize rule-to-diagnostic mappings. |
| Platform support | Windows prefixes and symlink behavior differ from Unix. | Test lexical paths on all platforms and canonical/symlink cases where the platform supports them; document unsupported fixture setup explicitly. |

## Dependencies and Assumptions

- ADR-0023's schema and interpolation syntax remain accepted v2 behavior.
- ADR-0024's `depends_on` relation is the only ordering input. The relation is
  transitive and a complete configuration has already passed missing/self/cycle
  validation before resource analysis.
- Service injection remains task-local; validators do not read service values
  from the process environment.
- `config check` remains the supported executable semantic validator; JSON
  Schema alone validates shape, not interpolation, repository containment,
  cross-references, or resource relationships.
- The quality gates introduced by ADR-0025 remain the evidence and compatibility
  boundary for the later implementation.
