# Proposal: Dependency-Aware Parallel Scheduling

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-08-28
**Change type:** Execution architecture, configuration contract, and test-plan specification

## Scope Notice

This OpenSpec defines the Phase 4 parallel-scheduling contract. It authorizes
the design and subsequent implementation of a private scheduler, execution
configuration, resource coordination, deterministic publication, and focused
evidence. This document itself adds no business implementation and does not
change the current serial runtime until the separately reviewed implementation
is accepted.

## Why

ADR-0024 established dependency closure and stable topological ordering, ADR-0026
established static service/log safety preflight, and ADR-0027 unified built-in
gates and external steps as `VerificationPlan` nodes. Execution remains serial,
so independent nodes cannot use available capacity. Adding worker threads
without a scheduler contract would make dependency readiness, service startup,
log ownership, output order, and cancellation depend on timing.

The phase-four work needs one explicit answer for each of these concerns:

- how users opt into parallel execution and cap concurrency;
- how only dependency-ready nodes are dispatched;
- how reusable and exclusive services are shared safely;
- how each node receives a non-colliding log path;
- how results are merged and printed in stable plan order;
- how cancellation, timeout, and failed ancestors affect queued and running
  nodes; and
- how performance and service-contention behavior are measured reproducibly.

## What Changes

- Define a private scheduler boundary consuming `VerificationPlan` and an
  explicit `ExecutionPolicy`.
- Add the optional v2 `[execution]` configuration with `parallel` and
  `max_parallel`, retaining serial behavior by default.
- Define stable ready-queue dispatch for dependency-independent nodes and a
  bounded worker capacity.
- Define service resource identities, shareability, lock ownership, startup
  reuse, and exactly-once cleanup.
- Define unique per-step log allocation and a single ordered result publisher.
- Define one cancellation, timeout, and failure-propagation contract for
  built-in gates and external steps.
- Define compatibility snapshots, contention/stability tests, and serial vs
  parallel performance evidence.

## Goals

1. Enable safe, bounded parallel execution of selected nodes that have no
   dependency path between them.
2. Preserve serial behavior, CLI output order, report paths, report shape, and
   `E1402`/`E1403`/`E1404` mappings for legacy configurations and
   `parallel = false`.
3. Prevent service races, duplicate startup, mutable shared-state races, and
   log-file overwrites before or during execution.
4. Make queued cancellation, running cancellation, timeout, skipped
   descendants, and multi-failure selection deterministic and testable.
5. Produce comparable performance and contention evidence using the baseline
   rules established by ADR-0025.

## Non-goals

- No new business gate, retry policy, distributed scheduler, or public Rust
  scheduler API.
- No relaxation of ADR-0026 static resource-preflight rules or ADR-0027
  mandatory legacy gate edges.
- No completion-order CLI/report output, shared step logs, process-global
  environment mutation, or implicit configuration repair.
- No change to existing report names, report schema, error codes, scope/profile
  semantics, or serial failure behavior without a separate compatibility
  decision.
- No claim that parallel execution always improves wall-clock time; benchmark
  results remain fixture, target, and hardware specific.

## Success Metrics

| Area | Success criterion |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration | Omitted `parallel` remains serial; enabled parallel mode uses a default `max_parallel` of 4, accepts 1–64, and rejects invalid values before side effects. |
| Scheduling | Ready nodes never exceed the effective limit, never start before successful dependencies, and use stable topological/configuration tie-breaking. |
| Resources | Static conflicts fail preflight; runtime locks prevent duplicate startup and unsafe concurrent use; cleanup occurs exactly once for all terminal states. |
| Logs and output | Every external node has a unique contained log path; CLI and reports publish results in stable plan order regardless of completion order. |
| Cancellation/failure | Queued and running cancellation, timeout, failed descendants, unrelated branches, and primary-error selection follow the documented policy and preserve public codes. |
| Performance | Fixed fixtures record serial/parallel wall time, per-step duration, peak concurrency, scheduler overhead, and service-start reuse with ADR-0025 metadata. |
| Stability | Repeated parallel runs show no leaked process, service, lock, or log artifact and produce equivalent normalized output. |

## Impact and Risk Assessment

**Risk: High.** Concurrency changes the timing and resource profile of the
verification boundary. A scheduler defect could bypass dependencies, leak a
service, overwrite evidence, or report a result in a nondeterministic order.

| Dimension | Impact | Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safety | Incorrect readiness or lock ownership could run unsafe work concurrently. | Reuse the validated plan/reachability relation, fail closed on static conflicts, and require runtime lock/cleanup tests. |
| Compatibility | Parallel completion can change visible ordering or failure selection. | Keep serial as the default, publish by stable plan order, and compare legacy snapshots byte-for-byte or field-for-field. |
| Performance | Workers increase CPU, descriptors, memory, and service capacity. | Enforce 1–64 bounds, record peak concurrency and overhead, and compare only compatible baseline series. |
| Cancellation | Fan-out and bounded cleanup may leave partial results. | Use one plan-level token, explicit terminal statuses, bounded waits, and actual process/service cleanup assertions. |
| Maintainability | Scheduler, lock registry, and publisher add coordination code. | Keep adapters task-local, centralize policy, prohibit map-iteration ordering, and require focused module tests. |

## Dependencies and Assumptions

- ADR-0024 remains the source of truth for dependency closure and stable
  topological ordering.
- ADR-0025 remains the source of truth for compatibility snapshots and
  benchmark metadata/regression thresholds.
- ADR-0026 static resource preflight runs before scheduler dispatch and is not
  weakened by runtime locking.
- ADR-0027 `VerificationPlan`, `PlanNode`, `NodeResult`, and synthesized gate
  edges are available as private inputs.
- Existing process cancellation and service adapters remain owners of their
  process-tree and external-resource cleanup operations.
- The implementation can provide a cancellation token and bounded asynchronous
  or equivalent worker coordination without exposing a new public API.
